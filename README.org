#+TITLE: Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation Software
* Overview
This project we are apply metamorphic testing to the evaluation of translation software. We are using round-trip translation metamorphic relation.
- Firstly, we have get test case from Wikipedia. Totally, have two category, one is single sentence, another is paragraph, which only comprise with sentences, not with list etc.
- Secondly, we have evaluation three translation tools, Youdao translation, bing translation and google translation
- Thirdly, we have using BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) and GMT (general text matcer) algorithm for evaluating the quality of translated text which has been using machine-translate.

* Test case
In our project, the of test cases are atomatically captured from the internet. 
We are using a dictionaries as key word put in Wikipedia search engine for get single sentence from Wikipedia.



** Wikipedia API

** Dictionary
Tushar, Shantanu (2013, pp. 219 - 220) show that WordList(Dictionary) is a standard file on all Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The wordList file is usually stored in /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words.[1]
The wordList story more than 60,000 meanful words.

In this project, an online website is applied to obatin the dictionary which has generated the wordlist programmed by stndards Unix tools.[2]
Due to the result to be catched in python will be a list-structure ASCII, the reuslt needs to be post-edited with spliting into individual words for using.   

** Get test case
To be make to result valid and accurate, the size test-semaple is supposed to be large enough. 
Considerd about the size of our group and the tools we have, the quatity of the testing sample is decided to be 1000 sentences.
In the dictionary there are near 70 thousands words , therefore, we generate a list of random numbers in range of (0,69903) and select 1000 valid ones as the indexes of wordlist to select each word.
This is the ideal situation because some words will be not able to find correctly in the actual programme running, which will be explained later. Therefore the random numbers to be run are likely to be more than 1000.
  

The specific steps are:
- Traverse each key word from Dictionary by the the random index.
- Put the key word into Wikipedia search engine(we have using Wikipedia APi)
- Search summary part of this key word in Wikipedia.
- If this key word have not recored in Wikipedia, We will be ingnore it, traverse the next key word(The specific method will discuss later).
- If have result, all of summary paragraph will be snatched.
- Since the paragraph we get is in list structure of senctences, the first sentence of the summary paragraph will be splited out as a test case.

Exception Solution:
As motioned above, there will be some words do not have the summary part or even not exist in wikipidia. 
Thus we use an exception to deal with such cases so that the programme will jump over this incorrect search without recording and move to the next search.
For every word, all the secntences that have been obtained will be written into text file as the results for the further translation and evalutaion.

To get and print the wordlist:
The wordlist will be obtained automatically which will be uesed for getting the sentence test cases。
Firstly, it will ask if the user want to print the wordlist out beccause the word itself is not the test object.
However that will make it more for the testers clear about where the test sentences come from. As a result, printing out the wordlist is optional.
When the user choose to print it out, all the indexes the words that has valid paragraph searching are recorded and they will be used to get and print out all the words.

** youdao translate
Youdao (有道) is a search engine released by Chinese internet company NetEase (網易).
This search engine not only support English and Chinese. Also can support lots of others language.
language spuuort list:
| language   | code   |
|------------+--------|
| Chinese    | zh-CHS |
| Japanese   | ja     |
| English    | EN     |
| Korean     | ko     |
| French     | fr     |
| Russion    | ru     |
| Portuguese | pt     |
| Spanish    | es     |
*** Create account, get application key and password
When you want to using youdao api for translation, First, you must creat a account in YOUDAO ZHI YUN. THis is link http://ai.youdao.com .
I have choose using my wechat to login ZHI YUN. Because, each time when I log in. I only need scan QR code in my wechat for convenience.
After you need do some set up for get appKey and key, both are inportance for you send POST requie.
There is step by step
- go to application management
- click my application
- creat a new application, filed info and create
- create a translation instance and bind with you application, which is you before you have created.

When you finish all of step you can start using YOUDAO API. :)

*** Using YOUDAO API guide
This youdao translate API, we can using http or https POST to send our sample data(sentence and paragraph) to youdao and get translated data return by JSON.

youdao api http address: http://openapi.youdao.com/api
youdao api https address: https://openapi.youdao.com/api


This is a exmple for translate good(English) word to chinese's POST URL.

| from       | text | from which language | True       | must in language support list(you also can set to auto)                                   |
| to         | text | target language     | True       | must in language support list(you also can set to auto)                                   |
| appKey     | text | application key     | True       | you can find in application management in youdao ZHI YUN                                  |
| salt       | text | random number       | True       |                                                                                           |
| sign       | text | signiture           | True       | MD5(appKey + q + salt + key) key you can find in application management in YOUDAO ZHI YUN |

You can get a JSON file back.
In JSON file only have two colum is importance in our system, one is errorCode, and another one is translation
If errorCode is 0 mean no error. and translation is our most inerest part is our translate result.
This is a example
{
   "errorCode": "0",
   "translation": ["大丈夫です"]
}
All of code for youdao, please have a look youdao.py in code folder
