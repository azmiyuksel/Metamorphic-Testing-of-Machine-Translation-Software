A (named , plural As, A's, as, a's or aes) is the first letter and the first vowel of the ISO basic Latin alphabet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The horizon or skyline is the apparent line that separates earth from sky, the line that divides all visible directions into two categories: those that intersect the Earth's surface, and those that do not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At many locations, the true horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the visible horizon
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word horizon derives from the Greek "ὁρίζων κύκλος" horizōn kyklos, "separating circle", from the verb ὁρίζω horizō, "to divide", "to separate", and that from "ὅρος" (oros), "boundary, landmark"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
"OK" (; also spelled "okay" or "ok") is an English word denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, assent, or acknowledgment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "OK" has frequently turned up as a loanword in many other languages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been described as the most frequently spoken or written word on the planet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As an adjective, "OK" principally means "adequate" or "acceptable" as a contrast to "bad" ("The boss approved this, so it is OK to send out"); it can also mean "mediocre" when used in contrast with "good" ("The french fries were great, but the burger was just OK")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It fulfills a similar role as an adverb ("Wow, you did OK for your first time skiing!")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As an interjection, it can denote compliance ("OK, I will do that"), or agreement ("OK, that is fine")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can mean "assent" when it is used as a noun ("the boss gave his OK to the purchase") or, more colloquially, as a verb ("the boss OKed the purchase")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "OK", as an adjective, can express acknowledgment without approval
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a versatile discourse marker or back-channeling item, it can also be used with appropriate voice tone to show doubt or to seek confirmation ("OK?" or "Is that OK?")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The aardvark ( ARD-vark; Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It receives a "least concern" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East and Southern Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its name means "earth wolf" in Afrikaans and Dutch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also called "maanhaar jackal" (Afrikaans for "mane jackal") or civet hyena, based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the civet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It eats insects, mainly termites – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to capture them
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern Africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its diet consists mainly of termites and insect larvae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abacá ( ah-bə-KAH; Filipino: Abaka [aβaˈka]), binomial name Musa textilis, is a species of banana native to the Philippines, grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The plant, also known as Manila hemp, has great economic importance, being harvested for its fiber, also called Manila hemp, extracted from the leaf-stems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The plant grows to 13–22 feet (4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0–6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 m), and averages about 12 feet (3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 m)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is classified as a hard fiber, along with coir, henequin and sisal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The abacus (plural abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abaci come in different designs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the post-Soviet states as a tool
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other designs, such as the Japanese soroban, have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating square roots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of these methods may work with non-natural numbers (numbers such as 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 and  3⁄4)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Although today many use calculators and computers instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus

The Hebrew term Abaddon (Hebrew: אֲבַדּוֹן‎‎, 'Ǎḇaddōn), and its two Greek equivalents Apollyon (Greek: Ἀπολλύων, Apollyon) as a person/being and Τάρταρος Tartaros as a place/time, appears in the Bible as name of a place, time, or personification/incarnation of destructive nature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the Hebrew Bible, Abaddon often appears alongside the place שְׁאוֹל (sheol), meaning the realm of the dead
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the New Testament Book of Revelation, an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of locusts; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11—"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, The Angel of Death
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" (Ἀβαδδὼν), and then translated ("which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Ἀπολλύων, Apollyon)))
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Latin Vulgate and the Douay Rheims Bible have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", exterminans being the Latin word for "destroyer"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Armed and Hammered was a hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario, spawned from the Kensington Market, BFG (Bunchofuckingoofs) scene
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They played their first show June 7, 1989 and their final show on April 19, 2003
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Originally formed by singer Mopa Dean, the bassist for Masochistic Religion, arguably Canada’s foremost goth band, and drummer Kyle, the earliest lineup also included Lamo, Philphee and BFG's Thor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By the time of Armed & Hammered's first release in 1991, the Fully Loaded cassette the latter three had given way to Hardcore Dave (guitar) and Kieran (bass), beginning the long revolving door of membership
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Armed and Hammered briefly reunited to play a set in support of GBH for their tour visit to Toronto in July 2010 and reformed in May 2012
In 1992, guitarists Big John and Dorian Wilde had replaced Hardcore Dave
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This line-up was featured on the next several releases: the split 7-inch records with Suckerpunch and Oppressed Logic and tracks on the various artists compilations Dead on the Road and Living in Fear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They were once banned from a repeat performance on Much Music
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was when they were playing Live at the Kumbaya festival in 1995
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Kumbaya was a festival held at the Molson Amphiteatre to benefit people living with aids which was broadcast live across Canada on Much Music
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They were removed from the rebroadcast the next day and their performance was replaced with an REM video
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Over the course of the mid-1990s, the band's line-up would change several times
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Guitarist Wilde left in 1994 and was replaced the following year by Kurf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Soon after, Kieran moved to the UK where he toured with The Varukers and formed The Restarts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was replaced by Rick Giroux, who was in turn replaced in 1997 by former Heatseekers and Suckerpunch bassist, Cindy Beattie
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The debut full-length, "It's About Fucking Time", was recorded over much of 1996 and 1997 and features both Rick and Cindy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The CD also features re-recordings of many of the songs from earlier releases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It also spent some time in the independent charts in Canada
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1998, Kurf left the band and in 1999 was replaced by former Abalienation guitarist, Mark Dickinson
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2000, following the release of The Negative Aspect of Positive Thinking CD, Mark returned to the US, leaving Armed and Hammered once again with one guitarist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2000, Mopa left the group to be replaced by Jaww singer, Doug McLarty
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After Mopa's departure the group became mostly inactive, playing only a handful of gigs before their final shows in early 2003
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mopa formed The G-Men in 2002, who played at least one gig with Armed & Hammered, on November 15, 2002 at Sneaky Dee's in Toronto
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These final shows featured the return of former members Kurf and Rick

Abalone is an award-winning two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent Lévi in 1987
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The game is arranged similar to Chinese checkers but without starting spaces and with a "moat" around the edge of the board
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Players start with 14 marbles instead of 10, there are only two "colors", and the starting arrangement is different
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 But the game also uses a hexagon with marbles and 5 pits on each edge
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abalone was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 million units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The year it was published it received one of the first Mensa Select awards in New York, New York
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is currently sold in more than thirty countries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The abampere (abA), also called the biot (Bi) after Jean-Baptiste Biot, is the basic electromagnetic unit of electric current in the emu-cgs system of units (electromagnetic cgs)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One abampere is equal to ten amperes in the SI system of units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abampere of current in a circular path of one centimeter radius produces a magnetic field of 2π oersteds at the center of the circle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The emu-cgs (or "electromagnetic cgs") units are one of several systems of electromagnetic units within the centimetre gram second system of units; others include esu-cgs, Gaussian units, and Lorentz–Heaviside units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In these other systems, the abampere is not one of the units; the "statcoulomb per second" or statampere is used instead
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The other units in this system related to the abampere are:
abcoulomb – the charge that passes in one second through any cross section of a conductor carrying a steady current of one abampere
abhenry – the self-inductance of a circuit or the mutual inductance of two circuits in which the variation of current at the rate of one abampere per second results in an induced electromotive force of one abvolt
abohm – the resistance of a conductor that, with a constant current of one abampere through it, maintains between its terminals a potential difference of one abvolt
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Self-abasement is voluntary self-punishment or humiliation in order to atone for some real or imagined wrongdoing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Self-abasement might have a religious aspect for those seeking humility before God, perhaps in the context of monastic or cenobitic lifestyle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It also has a sexual and fetish aspect for those people who enjoy erotic humiliation and other related BDSM practices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Examples of self-abasement practices include self-flagellation, bondage, torture, public humiliation (including online humiliation)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In psychology, self-abasement is associated with shame (rather than guilt) and involves the reduction of the subject's self-esteem
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The notion of self-abasement can be said to be based in Freudian psychoanalysis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Fear may also result in self-abasement

Abasia (from Greek: a-, without and basis, step) is the inability to walk owing to impairment in motor coordination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term covers a spectrum of medical disorders such as:
choreic abasia: caused by chorea of the legs
paralytic abasia: caused by paralysis of the leg muscles
spastic abasia: caused by spastic stiffening of the leg muscles
trembling abasia: caused by trembling of the legs
Abasia is frequently accompanied by astasis, an inability to stand, see Astasia-abasia

An abatis, abattis, or abbattis is a field fortification consisting of an obstacle formed (in the modern era) of the branches of trees laid in a row, with the sharpened tops directed outwards, towards the enemy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The trees are usually interlaced or tied with wire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abatis are used alone or in combination with wire entanglements and other obstacles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A lampshade is a fixture that covers the lightbulb on a lamp to diffuse the light it emits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Conical, cylindrical and other forms on floor-, desk- or table top-mounted as well as suspended lamp models are the most common and are made in a wide range of materials
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term can also apply to the glass hung under many designs of ceiling lamp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Beyond its practical purpose, significant emphasis is also usually given to decorative and aesthetic features

A slaughterhouse or abattoir  is a facility where animals are slaughtered for consumption as food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Slaughterhouses supply meat which then becomes the responsibility of the packaging department
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Slaughterhouses that process meat not intended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as knacker's yards or knackeries, used for animals that are not fit for consumption or can no longer work on a farm such as work horses that can no longer work
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant logistical problems, animal welfare problems, public health requirements, and environmental problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to public aversion in many cultures, determining where to build slaughterhouses is also troubling
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Animal welfare and animal rights groups frequently raise concerns about the methods of transport, preparation, herding, and killing within some slaughterhouses under the example of animal rights activists such as Howard Lyman and Ric O'Barry
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

ABBA (Swedish pronunciation: [²abːa]) were a Swedish pop group, formed in Stockholm in 1972 by members Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to have ever taken part in the competition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

ABBA's record sales figure is uncertain and various estimates range from over 140 to over 500 million sold records
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This makes them one of the best-selling music artists of all time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are also the best-selling band of all time from continental Europe and from outside the English-speaking world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ABBA were the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have a joint record eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

During the band's active years, Fältskog & Ulvaeus and Lyngstad & Andersson were married
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus–Fältskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson–Lyngstad marriage in 1981
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions featuring more introspective and dark lyrics in contrast to their usual pure-pop sound
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ABBA's music declined in popularity until the purchase of ABBA's catalogue and record company Polar by Polygram in 1989 enabled the groundwork to be laid for an international re-issue of all their original material and a new Greatest Hits (ABBA Gold) collection in September 1992 which became a worldwide smash
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several films, notably Muriel's Wedding (1994) and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), further revived public interest in the group and the spawning of several tribute bands
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A film of the same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

ABBA were honoured at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, when their hit "Waterloo" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2015, their song "Dancing Queen" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To Lua Foto (died 614) was Abbot of Clonmacnoise
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To Lua Foto was a member of the Corco Moga of what is now north-east County Galway
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Corco Moga's homeland was based around what is now the parish of Kilkerrin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the 10th century, the area was conquered by the Ui Briuin, who established a new dynasty of the Ui Diarmata as rulers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

He was preceded as abbot by Ailither and succeeded by Colman Moccu Bairdene
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abbati is an Italian surname
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Notable people with the surname include:
Giuseppe Abbati (1836-1868), Italian artist
Pietro Abbati (1768-1842), Italian mathematician
Pietro Giovanni Abbati (1683-1745), Italian set designer, painter, and engraver
Stefano Abbati (born 1955), Italian actor

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In Christianity, an abbess (Latin abbatissa, feminine form of abbas, abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abbey is a complex of buildings used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Religious life in an abbey may be monastic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are many famous abbeys across Europe
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The female equivalent is abbess
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abbreviation (from Latin brevis, meaning short) is a shortened form of a word or phrase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, abbrv
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, or abbrev
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions, crasis, acronyms, or initialisms, with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all four are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abbreviation (from Latin brevis, meaning short) is a shortened form of a word or phrase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, abbrv
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, or abbrev
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions, crasis, acronyms, or initialisms, with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all four are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction

The abcoulomb (abC or aC) or electromagnetic unit of charge (emu of charge) is the basic physical unit of electric charge in the cgs-emu system of units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One abcoulomb is equal to ten coulombs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

CGS-emu (or "electromagnetic cgs") units are one of several systems of electromagnetic units within the centimetre gram second system of units; others include CGS-esu, Gaussian units, and Lorentz–Heaviside units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In these other systems, the abcoulomb is not used; CGS-esu and Gaussian units use the statcoulomb is instead, while the Lorentz-Heaviside unit of charge has no specific name
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the electromagnetic cgs system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via Ampère's law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The definition of the abcoulomb follows from that of the abampere: given two parallel currents of one abampere separated by one centimetre, the force per distance of wire is 2 dyn/cm
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The abcoulomb is the charge flowing in 1 second given a current of 1 abampere

Abdāl (lit: substitutes, but which can also mean "generous" [karīm] and "noble" [sharīf]) is a term used in Islamic metaphysics and Islamic mysticism, both Sunni and Shiite, to refer to a particularly important group of God's saints
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the tradition of Sunni Islam in particular, the concept attained an especially important position in the writings of the Sunni mystics and theologians, whence it appears in the works of Sunni authorities as diverse as Abu Talib al-Makki (d
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 956), Ali Hujwiri (d
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 1072), Ibn Asakir (d
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 1076), Khwaja Abdullah Ansari (d
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 1088), and Ibn Khaldun (d
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 1406)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is a rank of forty saints, but more often the larger group of 356 saints in Sufi hagiography
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this theology it is said that they are only known to and appointed by Allah, and it is through their operations that the world continues to exist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term over time has come to include a greater hierarchy of saints, all of different rank and prestige
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Abdal" is the plural of "Badal" or rather "Badeel", and means "those who get replaced", "those who serve as a partial replacement to the role of the prophets" or "friends of God"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Abdals are the group of true, pure believers in God
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They serve God during their lifetime; when they die, they are immediately replaced by another selected by God from a larger group said to be the 500 "Akhyar", i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, the semi-divine good ones
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Abdals are headed by their leader, "Al-Ghawth" ("the Helper"), who is said to reside in Mecca
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This leader is often referred to as the Qutb, which means "Pole" in Arabic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This leader though unknown to the public is usually sought out by all of the lower ranking members of the abdal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At various times in history, shaykhs have been known to publicly claim to be the Qutb, despite the tradition of remaining outside of the public eye
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The missions of the Abdals are to be God's merciful subjects everywhere they reside and to render the helping blessing hand to all of God's creatures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is said that a Badal exists in each continent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although the majority live in "Al-Sham (Syria),"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
some live in Iraq, some in Lebanon, some in Egypt, some in Antioch, some in al-Massisa, South Africa and others live throughout the rest of the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have divine powers and super-natural abilities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A person does not recognize that he is one of the Abdal until he becomes aware of his status suddenly though a revelation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is said that a Badal can be identified through his continuous good deeds and forgiving nature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He may be rich or poor, married or bachelor, child or adult
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such concepts are established in the Sunni branch of Islam, and in particular in the latter’s original Sufi schools of spiritual disciplines
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The abdal function as the keepers of equilibrium in the world and preserve it between the times when prophets are present
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Varying in classification and denomination, the identity of the abdal are entirely unknown to the public and even to themselves
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 With the ability to transmit blessings (baraka) and perform miracles (karāmāt) the abdal as a whole are able to adequately fill the role of prophet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Similarly, it is believed that when judgement day comes, they will act as intermediaries (šafāʿa) between God and the human race
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As far as the number of the abdal is concerned, there are 300 friends of Allah in the creation whose hearts are like that of Adam
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are 40 whose hearts are similar to the heart of Musa and 7 whose hearts are similar to the heart of Ibrahim
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are 5 whose hearts are like that of Jibra’il and 3 whose hearts are like that of Mika’il and one whose heart is like the heart of Israfil
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When he (whose heart is like Israfil) dies, then one of the three whose heart is like Mika’il replaces him and one of the five (whose hearts are like Jibra’il) replaces him
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One of the seven replaces one of the five, one of the forty replaces one of the seven and one of the three-hundred replaces one of the forty and a normal Muslim replaces one of the three-hundred
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is due to these 356 awliya that creation are given life and killed, due to them rain falls, vegetation grows and difficulties are removed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also believed that since the number of abdal is so near to the number of days in the lunar calendar, their role as a part of the cosmic order of the universe is justified
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In Sufism, the Abdal are placed in a cosmic hierarchy with other orders of saintly individuals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two descriptions of the hierarchy come from notable Sufis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One comes from the 12th Century persian Ali Hujwiri
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In his divine court, there are three hundred akhyār (“excellent ones”), forty abdāl (“substitutes”), seven abrār (“piously devoted ones”), four awtād (“pillars”) three nuqabā (“leaders”) and one qutb
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The second version is from Ibn Arabī, who lived in Moorish Spain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has a more exclusive structure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are eight nujabā (“nobles”), twelve nuqabā, seven abdāl, four awtād, two a’immah (“guides”), and the qutb

The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Paracentesis (from Greek κεντάω, "to pierce") is a form of body fluid sampling procedure, generally referring to peritoneocentesis (also called laparocentesis or abdominal paracentesis) in which the peritoneal cavity is punctured by a needle to sample peritoneal fluid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The procedure is used to remove fluid from the peritoneal cavity, particularly if this cannot be achieved with medication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The most common indication is ascites that has developed in people with cirrhosis

This is a list of Latin words with derivatives in English (and other modern languages)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Ancient orthography did not distinguish between i and j or between u and v
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many modern works distinguish u from v but not i from j
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this article, both distinctions are shown as they are helpful when tracing the origin of English words

Abductive reasoning (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all uses of the terms abduction and inference to the best explanation are exactly equivalent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, computer science, and artificial intelligence research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diagnostic expert systems frequently employ abduction

Abecedarians is a name given to a 16th-century German sect of Anabaptists who rejected all human learning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Questions have been raised as to the historical accuracy of the name and sect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abecedarius is an acrostic in which the first letter of every word, strophe or verse follows the order of the alphabet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abecedarius is also a generic term for an alphabet book, which dates back to Biblical writings such as the Psalms, which used successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet as the first letter of each stanza
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Another example is Old Polish poem Skarga umierającego (A Dying Man Complaint)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such poems are important historical sources for development of orthography
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They can be proofs that some letters were used long ago and later were totally forgotten
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Bishop Constantine of Preslav's abecedarius (shown on the right) from 9th century documents the early Slavic alphabet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nowadays abecedariuses are written chiefly for children
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The most famous example of abecedarius in English literature is Geoffrey Chaucer's ABC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abecedarium (or abecedary) is an inscription consisting of the letters of an alphabet, almost always listed in order
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Typically, abecedaria (or abecedaries) are practice exercises

Cain and Abel (; Hebrew: הֶבֶל ,קַיִן‎ Qayin, Heḇel; Arabic: قابيل، هابيل‎‎ Qābīl, Hābīl) were sons of Adam and Eve in the biblical Book of Genesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cain, the firstborn, tilled the soil, and his brother Abel was a shepherd
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The brothers made sacrifices to God, each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cain murdered Abel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 God punished Cain to a life of wandering, but set a mark on him so that no man would kill him
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cain then dwelt in the land of Nod (נוֹד‎, "wandering"), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with Enoch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive (though it does describe him as being wrathful, and his motive is traditionally assumed to be envy), nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and Abel was the first to die

Abelia  is a genus of about 30 species and many hybrids in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some authors, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, consider Abelia and related genera to belong instead in the segregate family Linnaeaceae, also including such genera as Linnaea, Abelia, Dipelta, Kolkwitzia, and Zabelia, but not such others as Lonicera or Symphoricarpos, included by them instead in a more narrowly viewed Caprifoliaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abelias are shrubs from 1–6 m tall, native to eastern Asia (Japan west to the Himalaya) and southern North America (Mexico); the species from warm climates are evergreen, and colder climate species deciduous
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, ovate, glossy, dark green, 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5–8 cm long, turning purplish-bronze to red in autumn in the deciduous species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The flowers appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends, 1-8 together in a short cyme; they are pendulous, white to pink, bell-shaped with a five-lobed corolla, 1–5 cm long, and usually scented
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Flowering continues over a long and continuous period from late spring to fall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Type species of this genus is Abelia chinensis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The generic name commemorates Clarke Abel, a keen naturalist who accompanied Lord Amherst's unsuccessful embassy to China in 1816 as surgeon, under the sponsorship of Sir Joseph Banks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All of Abel's seeds and plants were lost in a shipwreck on the homeward voyage, however; living plants of Abelia chinensis were first imported to England in 1844 by Robert Fortune, who introduced A

Abelmoschus is a genus of about fifteen species of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, native to tropical Africa, Asia and northern Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was formerly included within Hibiscus, but is now classified as a distinct genus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, growing to 2 m tall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The leaves are 10–40 cm long and broad, palmately lobed with 3-7 lobes, the lobes are very variable in depth, from barely lobed, to cut almost to the base of the leaf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The flowers are 4–8 cm diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The fruit is a capsule, 5–20 cm long, containing numerous seeds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abelmoschus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Chionodes hibiscella which has been recorded on A

Abend is a German-language surname, meaning "evening"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Notable people with the surname include:

Aberdeen (; Scots: Aiberdeen,  listen ; Scottish Gaelic: Obar Dheathain [ˈopər ˈʝɛ
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
ɛɲ]; Latin: Aberdonia) is Scotland's third most populous city, one of Scotland's 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom's 37th most populous built-up area, with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen  and 229,800 for the local authority area
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Nicknames include the Granite City, the Grey City and the Silver City with the Golden Sands
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s, other nicknames have been the Oil Capital of the World or the Energy Capital of the World
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The area around Aberdeen has been settled since at least 8,000 years ago, when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The city has a long, sandy coastline and a marine climate, the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aberdeen received Royal Burgh status from David I of Scotland (1124–53), transforming the city economically
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The city's two universities, the University of Aberdeen, founded in 1495, and Robert Gordon University, which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east of Scotland
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen's seaport
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aberdeen has won the Britain in Bloom competition a record-breaking ten times, and hosts the Aberdeen International Youth Festival, a major international event which attracts up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2015, Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world, as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2012, HSBC named Aberdeen as a leading business hub and one of eight 'super cities' spearheading the UK's economy, marking it as the only city in Scotland to receive this accolade
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also called the European siskin, common siskin or just siskin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other (archaic) names include black-headed goldfinch, barley bird and aberdevine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is very common throughout Europe and Asia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is found in forested areas, both coniferous and mixed woodland where it feeds on seeds of all kinds, especially of alder and conifers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It can be distinguished from other similar finches by the color of the plumage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The upper parts are greyish green and the under parts grey-streaked white
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its wings are black with a conspicuous yellow wing bar, and the tail is black with yellow sides
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The male has a mainly yellow face and breast, with a neat black cap
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Female and young birds have a greyish green head and no cap
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a trusting, sociable and active bird
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The song of this bird is a pleasant mix of twitters and trills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For these reasons it is often raised in captivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These birds have an unusual migration pattern as every few years in winter they migrate southwards in large numbers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The reasons for this behaviour are not known but may be related to climatic factors and above all the availability of food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this way overwintering populations can thrive where food is abundant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This small finch is an acrobatic feeder, often hanging upside-down like a tit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It will visit garden bird feeding stations

Aberrant is a role-playing game created by White Wolf Game Studio in 1999, set in 2008 in a world where super-powered humans started appearing one day in 1998
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the middle setting in the greater Trinity Universe timeline, chronologically situated about 90 years after Adventure!, White Wolf's Pulp era game, and over a century before the psionic escapades of Trinity/Aeon
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The game deals with how the players' meta-human characters (called "novas") fit into a mundane world when they most definitely are not mundane, as well as how the mundane populace react to the sudden emergence of novas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The original Aberrant product line was discontinued in 2002, though a d20 System version was released in 2004
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Onyx Path Publishing has recently acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe and has announced its intention to release a new edition of Aberrant

Abetalipoproteinemia, or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that interferes with the normal absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins from food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is caused by a mutation in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in deficiencies in the apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100, which are used in the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons and VLDL respectively
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is not to be confused with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia

Abettor (from to abet, Old French abeter, à and beter, to bait, urge dogs upon any one; this word is probably of Scandinavian origin, meaning to cause to bite), is a legal term implying one who instigates, encourages or assists another to commit an offence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An abettor differs from an accessory in that he must be present at the commission of the crime; in addition they are equally guilty as they knowingly and voluntarily assist in the commission of that crime
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a solvent person in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

More recently, an abettor is generally known as an accomplice
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro (Montenegrin: Орден Књаза Данила I, Orden Knjaza Danila I) was an order of the Principality, and later Kingdom, of Montenegro
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is currently granted as a dynastic honor by the undisputed head of the House of Petrović-Njegoš, Nicholas Petrović Njegoš II
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although no longer a state order, recognition is indicated by the acceptance of the former President of Montenegro, Filip Vujanović
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 More formal recognition by the Republic of Montenegro is implicit in the 2011 "Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty", which recognizes the current crown prince as head of the Royal Family and specifically sanctions the use of the royal family's heraldic symbols
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The act also provides the Crown Prince housing and a pension and has been noted as conferring a sort of "quasi restoration" of the throne
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In a May 15th Pobjeda newspaper interview, Prince Nikola cited Article 3 of this law as the basis for his May 5th re-institution of the Order, which he emphasized was "historically an extremely valuable Montenegrin decoration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" He went on to explain that the order can be awarded to Montenegrin nationals and worthy foreigners on two general grounds: (1), for support and affirmation of Montenegrin independence and the royal tradition of the Petrovic Njegos dynasty, and (2) to those whose "scientific or social work contributed to the development of culture, art and science
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" The Order has since been bestowed on a number of high dignitaries internationally
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In an April 17, 2016 visit to Rome, HRH Prince Nikola II Petrovic Njegoš met with Pope Francis and other high Vatican officials bestowing the dynastic honor on the Cambodian ambassador, His Highness Prince Sisowath Ravivaddhana Monipong, the Montenegrin ambassador to the Holy See Veselin Šuković, as well as the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Ambassador to the Holy See Kenneth Francis Hackett, and the ambassador of Hungary HIRH Eduard von Habsburg-Lothringen, among several other Vatican officials and Italian nobles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The official Representative of the Royal House and the order is H
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
E
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Giuseppe Tedischi GCDO, who also has the Vatican charge "Addetto di Anticamera di Sua Santità," or Officer of Antechamber of His Holiness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Order was the first Montenegrin dynastic and state Order established by Prince Danilo Petrović Njegoš in 1853, as the Order of Danilo I for the Independence of Montenegro in 1852-53
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This decoration is still awarded to prominent champions of the preservation of Montenegrin independence and, as indicated above, for other humanitarian, scientific, artistic and pro-social achievements pursuant to the conditions by which the Order is awarded were defined by statute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Alterations were made to the appearance of the original decoration created by Prince Danilo, and during the rule of His Majesty King Nikola I Petrović Njegoš the Order underwent two restructures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the first restructure in 1861, three classes were introduced, while in the second restructure, from 1873, an additional class was added, so that not only is there a star in the 1st class but also a 2nd class with star was introduced
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By 1922, the order consisted of five classes: Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer, and knight or Chevalier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 More changes occurred and today's five classes are:
Grand Cross I, (Sash and Large Chest Star)--Cavaliere di Grande Croce (1st Class)
Grand Officer II (Neck Cross, Sash, Chest Star)--Grande Uffiale (2nd Class)
Knight Commander III Neck Cross, Chest Star--Commendatore (3rd Class)
Knight IV Chest Cross--Cavaliere (4th Class)
Member V Chest Cross (Black and Silver)--Member (5th Class)
On Saturday June 4, 2005, Cetinje, the old Royal Capital of Montenegro, hosted the first gala ceremony of the Order in the country in 90 years
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abeyance (from the Old French abeance meaning "gaping") is a state of expectancy in respect of property, titles or office, when the right to them is not vested in any one person, but awaits the appearance or determination of the true owner
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such future estates as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with remainder to the heir of B
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of B it is uncertain who is B's heir
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Similarly the freehold of a benefice, on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term hold in abeyance is used in lawsuits and court cases when a case is temporarily put on hold
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abhor (or Amba Hor) and Mehraela were a brother and sister who were martyrs for the Christian faith
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The book of their "acts" has been lost
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their feast day is celebrated on January 9 in the Coptic Church

Abhorrence is a Finnish death metal band originally formed in 1989
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abhorrers, the name given in 1679 to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King Charles II of England to assemble Parliament
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Feeling against Catholics, and especially against James, Duke of York, was running strongly; the Exclusion Bill had been passed by the House of Commons, and the popularity of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, was very great
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had prorogued its successor, which became known as the Exclusion Bill Parliament, without allowing it to meet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir George Jeffreys and Francis Wythens, who presented addresses expressing abhorrence of the Petitioners, and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "The frolic went all over England," says Roger North; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the Petitioners
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is said that the terms Whig and Tory were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abidin or Abdin is both an Arabic given name and surname, meaning "worshippers"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Notable people with the name include:
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
"Abide with Me" is a Christian hymn by Scottish Anglican Henry Francis Lyte most often sung to English composer William Henry Monk's tune entitled "Eventide"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Lyte wrote the poem in 1847 and set it to music while he lay dying from tuberculosis; he survived only a further three weeks after its completion

Abidjan (French pronunciation: ​[abidʒɑ̃]) is the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire and is one of the most populous French-speaking cities in Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to the 2014 Côte d'Ivoire census, Abidjan's population was 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country, and this also makes it the 4th most populous city proper in Africa, after Lagos, Cairo and Kinshasa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Considered the cultural crossroads of Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abidjan remained the capital of Côte d'Ivoire after its independence from France in 1960
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important sea port
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1983, the city of Yamoussoukro was designated as the official political capital of Cote d'Ivoire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, almost all political institutions and foreign embassies continue to be located in Abidjan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Because Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the "economic capital" of the country
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Abidjan Autonomous District, which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 districts of Côte d'Ivoire

Firs (Abies) are a genus of 48–56 species of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are found through much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, occurring in mountains over most of the range
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Firs are most closely related to the genus Cedrus (cedar)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Douglas firs are not true firs, being of the genus Pseudotsuga
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They are large trees, reaching heights of 10–80 m (33–262 ft) tall and trunk diameters of 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5–4 m (1 ft 8 in–13 ft 1 in) when mature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the unique attachment of their needle-like leaves and by their different cones
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Identification of the different species is based on the size and arrangement of the leaves, the size and shape of the cones, and whether the bract scales of the cones are long and exserted, or short and hidden inside the cone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abigail (Hebrew: אֲבִיגַיִל‎ / אֲבִיגָיִל‎, Modern Avigáyil Tiberian ʾĂḇîḡáyil / ʾĂḇîḡāyil)) spelled Abigal in 2 Samuel 17:25 in the American Standard Version and Ab'igal in the Revised Standard Version, but Abigail in the King James Version}} was the wife of Nabal; she became a wife of the future King David after Nabal's death (1 Samuel 25)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abigail was David's third wife, after Saul's daughter, Michal, whom Saul later married to Palti, son of Laish when David went into hiding, and Ahinoam
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

She became the mother of one of David's sons, who is listed in the Book of Chronicles under the name Daniel, in the Masoretic Text of the Books of Samuel as Chileab, and in the Septuagint text of 2 Samuel 3:3 as Δαλουια, Dalouia

Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The female equivalent is abbess

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abiogenesis (British English: , ), biopoiesis, or informally the origin of life, is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abiogenesis is studied through a combination of paleontology, laboratory experiments and extrapolation from the characteristics of modern organisms, and aims to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life on Earth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The study of abiogenesis can be geophysical, chemical, or biological, with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Life itself is dependent upon the specialized chemistry of carbon and water and is largely based upon five different families of chemicals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lipids are fatty molecules comprising large chemical chains of hydrocarbons and play an important role in the structure of living cell membranes, actively and passively determining the transport of other molecules into and out of cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Carbohydrates are sugars, and as monomer units can be assembled into polymers called polysaccharides, such as cellulose, the rigid chemical of most plant cell walls
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nitrogenous bases are organic molecules in which the amine group of nitrogen, combined with two hydrogen atoms, plays an important part
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Chlorophyll is based upon a porphyrin ring derived from amine monomer units, and is important in the capture of the energy needed for life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nucleic acid monomers are made from a carbohydrate monosaccharide, a nitrogenous base and one or more high energy phosphate groups
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When joined together they form the unit of inheritance, the gene, made from DNA or RNA, which translates the genetic information into protein structures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The monomer unit of a protein is usually one of 20 amino acids, comprising an amine group, a hydrocarbon, and a carboxylic acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Through a condensation reaction, in which the carboxylic acid of one amino acid is linked to the amine of another with removal of a water molecule, a peptide bond is formed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Polymers of amino acids are termed proteins and these molecules provide many catalytic metabolic functions for living processes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these five classes of molecules
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is generally thought that current life on Earth is descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The classic Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the basic chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions have been proposed, including lightning and radiation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other approaches ("metabolism-first" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Complex organic molecules have been found in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The panspermia hypothesis alternatively suggests that microscopic life was distributed to the early Earth by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies and that life may exist throughout the Universe
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is speculated that the biochemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the age of the universe was only 10 to 17 million years old
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The panspermia hypothesis proposes that life originated outside the Earth, not how life came to be
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Nonetheless, Earth remains the only place in the Universe known to harbour life, and fossil evidence from the Earth informs most studies of abiogenesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 More than 99% of all species of life forms, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The age of the Earth is about 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
54 billion years old; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 billion years ago, and possibly as early as the Eoarchean Era (between 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
6 to 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0 billion years ago), after geological crust started to solidify following the molten Hadean Eon
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land may have been found in 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, there have been a number of discoveries that suggested the earliest appearance of life on Earth was even earlier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Currently, microfossils within hydrothermal vent precipitates dated from 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
77 to 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
28 billion years old found in Quebec, Canada may be the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" after ocean formation 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4 billion years ago
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe

 However, there have been a number of discoveries that suggested the earliest appearance of life on Earth was even earlier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Currently, microfossils within hydrothermal vent precipitates dated from 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
77 to 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
28 billion years old found in Quebec, Canada may be the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" after ocean formation 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4 billion years ago

 According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe

Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA), also referred to as the cerebellar cortical abiotrophy (CCA), is a genetic neurological disease in animals best known to affect certain breeds of horses, dogs and cats
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can also develop in humans
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It develops when the neurons known as Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum of the brain, begin to die off
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These cells affect balance and coordination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have a critical role to play in the brain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 People with damage to the cerebellum can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abiotrophy means the loss of a vital nutritive factor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The exact cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an intrinsic metabolic defect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In most cases, the Purkinje neurons begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

CA cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Genetic testing can detect carriers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to dogs and horses, there also have been cases of cerebellar abiotrophy in Siamese and Domestic shorthair cats; in Angus, Polled Hereford, Charolais and Holstein Friesian cattle; Merino and Wiltshire sheep; and Yorkshire pigs

Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The female equivalent is abbess

The term abjection literally means "the state of being cast off
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" While in common usage it has connotations of degradation, baseness and meanness of spirit, the term has been explored in post-structuralism as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is Julia Kristeva's (pursued particularly in her work Powers of Horror)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is self and what is other
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self – be it physical and biological, social or cultural – from that which one considers intolerable and infringes upon one's 'self', otherwise known as the abject
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The abject is, as such, the "me that is not me
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly and effectively to explain popular cultural narratives of horror and misogyny, and builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan

Weaning is the process of gradually introducing a mammal infant to what will be its adult diet and withdrawing the supply of its mother's milk
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The process takes place only in mammals, as only mammals produce milk
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The infant is considered to be fully weaned once it is no longer fed any breast milk (or bottled substitute)

Ablation is removal of material from the surface of an object by vaporization, chipping, or other erosive processes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Examples of ablative materials are described below, and include spacecraft material for ascent and atmospheric reentry, ice and snow in glaciology, biological tissues in medicine and passive fire protection materials
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The ablative case (sometimes abbreviated abl) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the grammar of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word "ablative" derives from the Latin ablatus, the (irregular) perfect passive participle of auferre "to carry away"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as German, nor in ancient Greek
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In linguistics, apophony (also known as ablaut, (vowel) gradation, (vowel) mutation, alternation, internal modification, stem modification, stem alternation, replacive morphology, stem mutation, internal inflection etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) is any sound change within a word that indicates grammatical information (often inflectional)

The Pains of Being Pure at Heart are an American indie pop band from New York City, formed in 2007
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The band currently centers around founding member and principal songwriter Kip Berman (vocals, guitar)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Live he is joined by Christoph Hochheim (guitar), Jen Goma (keyboards, vocals), Jacob Sloan (bass), and Anton Hochheim (drums)

A papal legate or Apostolic legate (from the Ancient Roman title legatus) is a personal representative of the pope to foreign nations, or to some part of the Catholic Church
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He is empowered on matters of Catholic Faith and for the settlement of ecclesiastical matters
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The legate is appointed directly by the pope (the bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church and (historically) head of state of the papal states)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Hence a legate is usually sent to a government, a sovereign or to a large body of believers (such as a national church) or to take charge of a major religious effort, such as an (ecumenical) council, a crusade to the Holy Land, or even against a heresy such as the Cathars
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term legation is applied both to a legate's mandate and to the territory concerned (such as a state, or an ecclesiastical province)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The relevant adjective is legatine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Ableism  (also known as ablism, disablism, anapirophobia, anapirism, disability discrimination, and handicapism) is discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non-disabled
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, or character traits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Discrimination faced by those who have or are perceived to have a mental disorder is sometimes called mentalism rather than ableism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are stereotypes associated with various disabilities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These stereotypes in turn serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory attitudes and behaviors toward people who are disabled
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Labeling affects people when it limits their options for action or changes their identity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In ableist societies, people with disabilities are viewed as less valuable to society, or even less than human
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The eugenics movement of the early 20th century could be considered an example of widespread ableism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The mass murder of disabled in the German Nazi Government's Aktion T4 could be an extreme example of ableism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Other definitions of ableism include those of Chouinard, who defines it as "ideas, practices, institutions, and social relations that presume able-bodiedness, and by so doing, construct persons with disabilities as marginalized […] and largely invisible 'others,'" and of Amundson and Taira, who define ableism as "a doctrine that falsely treats impairments as inherently and naturally horrible and blames the impairments themselves for the problems experienced by the people who have them

Ablepharus is a genus of skinks that contains the common snake-eyed skinks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their name refers to the fact that their eyelids have fused to a translucent capsule; as in snakes, they thus are physically incapable of blinking
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They resemble small lizards and prefer to live in the leaf litter of dry fields and hills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their scales give them a very shiny, bronze appearance with a characteristically dark stripe down the sides of their bodies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They prey on small insects and other small mollusks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Refractive errors include near sighted, far sighted, presbyopia, and astigmatism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, premature birth, or trauma among others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These cases are known as cortical visual impairment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diagnosis is by an eye exam
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work

The Abenaki (Abnaki, Abinaki, Alnôbak) are a Native American tribe and First Nation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are one of the Algonquian-speaking peoples of northeastern North America
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Abenaki live in Quebec and the Maritimes of Canada and in the New England region of the United States, a region called Wabanahkik ("Dawn Land") in the Eastern Algonquian languages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Abenaki are one of the five members of the Wabanaki Confederacy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Abenaki" is a linguistic and geographic grouping; historically there was not a strong central authority
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As listed below, there were numerous smaller bands and tribes who shared many cultural traits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They came together as a post-contact community after their original tribes were decimated by colonization, disease, and warfare

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Denial, in ordinary English usage, is asserting that a statement or allegation is not true
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The same word, and also abnegation (German: Verneinung), is used for a psychological defense mechanism postulated by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming evidence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist or true believer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The subject may use:
simple denial: deny the reality of the unpleasant fact altogether
minimisation: admit the fact but deny its seriousness (a combination of denial and rationalization)
projection: admit both the fact and seriousness but deny responsibility by blaming somebody or something else
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Self-denial (also called self-abnegation and self-sacrifice) refers to altruistic abstinence – the willingness to forgo personal pleasures or undergo personal trials in the pursuit of the increased good of another
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Various religions and cultures take differing views of self-denial, some considering it a positive trait and others considering it a negative one
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to some Protestants, self-denial is considered a superhuman virtue only obtainable through Jesus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some critics of self-denial suggest that self-denial can lead to self-hatred and claim that the self-denial practiced in Judaism has created self-hating Jews

f
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Norm (social)) or differing from the typical (such as an aberration), is a subjectively defined behavioral characteristic, assigned to those with rare or dysfunctional conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Behavior is considered abnormal when it is atypical, out of the ordinary, causes some kind of impairment, or consists of undesirable behavior
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Often what is abnormal, or what is not abnormal, is determined by an individual's culture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The definition of what abnormal behavior is a contentious issue in abnormal psychology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an assumption that abnormal behavior is a disorder that has a physical cause, specifically that it is related to the physical structure of the brain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A diagnosis of a mental disorder describes a patient who has a medical condition and the doctor makes a judgment that the patient is exhibiting abnormal behavior
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The distinction being that mental disorders describe processes, not people

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Human sexuality is the quality of being sexual, or the way people experience and express themselves as sexual beings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Because it is a broad term, which has varied over time, it lacks a precise definition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Someone's sexual orientation can influence that person's sexual interest and attraction for another person
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Physical and emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds between individuals that is expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of love, trust, and care
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Interest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches puberty
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Opinions differ on the origins of an individual's sexual orientation and sexual behavior
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some argue that sexuality is determined by genetics, while others believe it is molded by the environment, or that both of these factors interact to form the individual's sexual orientation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This pertains to the nature versus nurture debate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the former, one assumes that the features of a person innately correspond to their natural inheritance, exemplified by drives and instincts; the latter refers to the assumption that the features of a person continue to change throughout their development and nurturing, exemplified by ego ideals and formative identifications
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Evolutionary perspectives on human coupling, reproduction and reproduction strategies, and social learning theory provide further views of sexuality
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Socio-cultural aspects of sexuality include historical developments and religious beliefs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Examples of these include Jewish views on sexual pleasure within marriage and some views of other religions on avoidance of sexual pleasures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some cultures have been described as sexually repressive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The study of sexuality also includes human identity within social groups, sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs), and birth control methods

A malocclusion is a misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term was coined by Edward Angle, the "father of modern orthodontics", as a derivative of occlusion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This refers to the manner in which opposing teeth meet (mal- + occlusion = "incorrect occlusion")

The abohm is the basic unit of electrical resistance in the emu-cgs (centimeter-gram-second) system of units (emu stands for "electromagnetic units")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One abohm is equal to 10−9 ohms in the SI system of units; one abohm is a nanoohm
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The emu-cgs (or "electromagnetic cgs") units are one of several systems of electromagnetic units within the centimetre gram second system of units; others include esu-cgs, Gaussian units, and Lorentz–Heaviside units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In these other systems, the abohm is not one of the units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

When a current of one abampere (1 abA) flows through a resistance of 1 abohm, the resulting potential difference across the component is one abvolt (1 abV)

Aboiteau farming on reclaimed marshland is a labor-intensive method in which earthen dykes are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A wooden sluice or aboiteau (plural aboiteaux) is then built into the dyke, with a hinged door (clapper valve) that swings open at low tide to allow fresh water to drain from the farmland but swings shut at high tide to prevent salt water from inundating the fields
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aboiteau farming is intimately linked with the story of French Acadian colonization of the shores of Canada's Bay of Fundy in the 17th and 18th centuries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the Kamouraska region of the St
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lawrence Valley of Quebec, aboiteau diking of salt marshes was closely tied to the modernization of agriculture in the 19th and early 20th centuries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Acadians constructed earthen dykes to isolate areas of salt marsh from repeated inundation by the tides
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A rare original "aboiteau" is the jewel of the West Pubnico Acadian Museums' artifacts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1990, local residents found a couple of boards sticking out of an eroding beach on Double Island, West Pubnico
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They returned to the site in 1996 to remove the aboiteau, to preserve and display it at the museum

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The abolition of monarchy has occurred throughout history, either through revolutions, coups d'état, wars, or legislative reforms (such as abdications)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The founding of the Roman Republic is a noteworthy example and became part of the nation's traditions including as justification for the assassination of Julius Caesar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The twentieth century saw a major acceleration of this process, with many monarchies violently overthrown by revolution or war, or else abolished as part of the process of decolonisation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By contrast, the restoration of monarchies is rare in modern times, with only two major examples, Spain and Cambodia

Abolitionism is a movement to end slavery, whether formal or informal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism is a historical movement to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 King Charles I of Spain, usually known as Emperor Charles V, following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315, passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and so was not enforced
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the late 17th century, the Roman Catholic Church, taking up a plea by Lourenco da Silva de Mendouca, officially condemned the slave trade, which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds, arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Soon after his death in 1785, they joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Somersett Case in 1772, in which a fugitive slave was freed in England with the judgement that slavery did not exist under English common law and was thus prohibited in England, helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labour continued to do so: Dutch, French, English, Spanish and Portuguese territories in the West Indies; South America; and the Southern United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After the American Revolution established the United States, northern states, beginning with Pennsylvania in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual emancipation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Massachusetts ratified a constitution that declared all men equal; freedom suits challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vermont, which existed as an unrecognized state from 1777 to 1791, abolished adult slavery in 1777
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other states, such as Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the following decades, the abolitionist movement grew in northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery in new states admitted to the union
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

France abolished slavery within the French Kingdom (continental France) in 1315
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Revolutionary France abolished slavery in France's colonies in 1794, although it was restored by Napoleon with the Law of 20 May 1802 as part of a program to ensure French sovereignty over its colonies

In Eastern Europe, groups organized to abolish the enslavement of the Roma in Wallachia and Moldavia; and to emancipate the serfs in Russia (Emancipation reform of 1861)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was declared illegal in 1948 under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The last country to abolish legal slavery was Mauritania, where it was officially abolished by presidential decree in 1981

Elfazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Presumably it has sedative and anxiolytic actions like those of other benzodiazepines
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Orexigenic properties in animals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The mechanism for increasing feed intake is not clear and has been subject of investigation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been found that elfazepam suppresses gastric acid secretion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The abomasum, also known as the maw, rennet-bag, or reed tripe, is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It secretes rennet, which is used in cheese creation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The word abomasum is from New Latin and it was first used in English in 1706
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It comes from Latin ab- + omasum "intestine of an ox," and it is possibly from the Gaulish language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The abomasum's normal anatomical location is along ventral midline
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a secretory stomach similar in anatomy and function as the monogastric stomach
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It serves primarily in the acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Dairy cattle on high production diets are susceptible to a number of pathologies, most commonly after calving
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A gas-filled abomasum can move into an abnormal location, resulting in left-displaced abomasum (LDA) or right-displaced abomasum (RDA)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the abomasum displaces to the right, it is at risk of torsion and becoming a right torsioned abomasum (RTA)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A displaced abomasum will cause cows to present all or some of the following signs: loss of appetite, decrease rumen contractions, decrease cud chewing, and drop in milk production
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While an LDA and RDA are not immediately life-threatening, veterinary care is required for surgical correction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Milder cases can be corrected by rolling the cow over or forcing her to run up a steep hill
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abomasitis is a relatively rare, but serious, disease of the abomasum whose causes are currently unknown
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The abomasum is used to make the lampredotto, a typical dish of Florence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also fried and eaten with onions as part of the Korean dish Makchang gui
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Another dish made with the abomasum is Turkish Şırdan

Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by removing a fetus or embryo before it can survive outside the uterus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a miscarriage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an induced abortion, or less frequently, "induced miscarriage"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word abortion is often used to mean only induced abortions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a "late termination of pregnancy"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

When allowed by law, abortion in the developed world is one of the safest procedures in medicine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When performed legally and safely, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The World Health Organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with a little under half done unsafely
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2008, 40% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Since ancient times, abortions have been done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other traditional methods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abortifacient ("that which will cause a miscarriage" from Latin: abortus "miscarriage" and faciens "making") is a substance that induces abortion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abortifacients for animals that have mated undesirably are known as mismating shots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Common abortifacients used in performing medical abortions include mifepristone, which is typically used in conjunction with misoprostol in a two-step approach
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Oxytocin is commonly used to induce abortion in the second or third trimester
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are also several herbal mixtures with abortifacient claims, though there are no available data on the efficacy of these plants in humans

Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with a little under half done unsafely
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2008, 40% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason

 In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder

Abolitionism is a movement to end slavery, whether formal or informal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism is a historical movement to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 King Charles I of Spain, usually known as Emperor Charles V, following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315, passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and so was not enforced
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the late 17th century, the Roman Catholic Church, taking up a plea by Lourenco da Silva de Mendouca, officially condemned the slave trade, which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds, arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Soon after his death in 1785, they joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Somersett Case in 1772, in which a fugitive slave was freed in England with the judgement that slavery did not exist under English common law and was thus prohibited in England, helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labour continued to do so: Dutch, French, English, Spanish and Portuguese territories in the West Indies; South America; and the Southern United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After the American Revolution established the United States, northern states, beginning with Pennsylvania in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual emancipation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Massachusetts ratified a constitution that declared all men equal; freedom suits challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vermont, which existed as an unrecognized state from 1777 to 1791, abolished adult slavery in 1777
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other states, such as Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the following decades, the abolitionist movement grew in northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery in new states admitted to the union
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

France abolished slavery within the French Kingdom (continental France) in 1315
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Revolutionary France abolished slavery in France's colonies in 1794, although it was restored by Napoleon with the Law of 20 May 1802 as part of a program to ensure French sovereignty over its colonies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Haiti formally declared independence from France in 1804 and brought an end to slavery in its territory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The northern states in the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 all abolished slavery by 1804
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The United Kingdom and the United States outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, after which Britain led efforts to block slave ships
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Britain abolished slavery throughout the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, the French colonies re-abolished it in 1848 and the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In Eastern Europe, groups organized to abolish the enslavement of the Roma in Wallachia and Moldavia; and to emancipate the serfs in Russia (Emancipation reform of 1861)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was declared illegal in 1948 under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The last country to abolish legal slavery was Mauritania, where it was officially abolished by presidential decree in 1981
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Today, child and adult slavery and forced labour are illegal in most countries, as well as being against international law, but a high rate of human trafficking for labour and for sexual bondage continues to affect tens of millions of adults and children

Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by removing a fetus or embryo before it can survive outside the uterus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a miscarriage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an induced abortion, or less frequently, "induced miscarriage"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word abortion is often used to mean only induced abortions

Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, or The Brief Relation of the Exceeding Mercy of God in Christ to his Poor Servant John Bunyan is a Puritan spiritual autobiography written by John Bunyan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was composed while Bunyan was serving a twelve-year prison sentence in Bedford gaol for preaching without a license and was first published in 1666
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The title contains allusions to two Biblical passages: 'Grace Abounding' is a reference to the Epistle to the Romans 5:20, which states 'Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound' (KJV) and 'Chief of Sinners' refers to First Epistle to Timothy 1:15, where Paul refers to himself by the same appellation

Misunderstandings of p-values are an important problem in scientific research and scientific education
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 P-values are often used or interpreted incorrectly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The data obtained by comparing the p-value to a significance level will yield one of two results: either the null hypothesis is rejected (which however does not imply that the null hypothesis is false), or the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at that significance level (which however does not imply that the null hypothesis is true)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Ronald Fisher's formulation, a low p-value means either that the null hypothesis is true and a highly improbable event has occurred or that the null hypothesis is false

Abadeh (Persian: آباده ‎‎, also Romanized as Ābādeh) is a city in and the capital of Abadeh County, in Fars Province, Iran
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abadeh is situated at an elevation of 6,200 feet (1,890 m) in a fertile plain on the high road between Isfahan and Shiraz, 190 kilometres (120 mi) from the former and 270 kilometres (170 mi) from the latter
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At the 2006 census, its population was 52,042, in 14,184 families
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2009, the population was estimated to be 59,042
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is the largest city in the Northern Fars Region (South Central-Iran), which is famed for its carved wood-work, made of the wood of pear and box trees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sesame oil, castor oil, grain, and various fruits are also produced there
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The area is famous for its Abadeh rugs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An interesting fact is that Abadeh is closer, road-distance-wise to 4 provincial capitals of Isfahan (193 km), Yasuj (197 km), Yazd (217 km), and Shahrekord (237 km) compared to the distance to the provincial capital of its corresponding province, Shiraz (260 km)

Abraham (Hebrew: אַבְרָהָם, Modern Avraham, Tiberian ʾAḇrāhām, Arabic: إبراهيم Ibrahim), originally Avram or Abram, is the common patriarch of the three Abrahamic religions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God; in Christianity, he is the prototype of all believers, Jewish or Gentile; and in Islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan, but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham, but all are dismissed except for Isaac, his son by his half-sister Sarah
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land, and in the second generation his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons, but on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives "all Abraham's goods", while the other sons receive only "gifts" (Genesis 25:5–8)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age, along with the exodus and the period of the judges, is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their "father Abraham", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on Moses and the Exodus tradition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abrasive is a material, often a mineral, that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common uses for abrasives include grinding, polishing, buffing, honing, cutting, drilling, sharpening, lapping, and sanding (see abrasive machining)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (For simplicity, "mineral" in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
Files are not abrasives; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing, but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file, very much like those of a saw
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A narrow-body aircraft or single-aisle aircraft is an airliner arranged along a single aisle permitting up to 6-abreast seating in a cabin below 4 metres (13 ft) of width
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In contrast, a wide-body aircraft is a larger airliner usually configured with multiple aisles and a fuselage diameter of more than 5 metres (16 ft) allowing at least seven-abreast seating and often more travel classes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The highest seating capacity of a narrow-body aircraft is 295 passengers in the Boeing 757–300, while wide-body aircraft can accommodate between 250 and 600 passengers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


2-abreast aircraft seats typically 4 to 19 passengers, 3-abreast 24 to 45, 4-abreast 44 to 80, 5-abreast 85 to 130, 6-abreast 120 to 230
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For the flight length, medium-haul aircraft are typically the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, while regional airliners typically cover short haul
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Historically, beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1990s, twin engine narrow-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 Classic, McDonnell-Douglas MD-80 and Airbus A320 were primarily employed in short to medium-haul markets requiring neither the range nor the passenger-carrying capacity of that period's wide-body aircraft
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The re-engined B737 Max and A320neo jets offer 500 miles more range, allowing them to operate the 3,000 miles transatlantic flights between the eastern U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 and Western Europe, previously dominated by wide-body aircraft
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and TAP Portugal will open up direct routes bypassing airline hubs for lower fares between cheaper, smaller airports
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The B737NG 3,300-mile range is insufficient for fully laden operations and operate at reduced capacity like the A318, while the Airbus A321LR could replace the less fuel efficient B757s used since its production end in 2004
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Boeing will face competition and pricing pressure from the Embraer E-Jet E2 family, Bombardier CSeries and Comac C919

An abridgement (or abridgment) is a condensing or reduction of a book or other creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the source
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The abridgement can be true to the original work in terms of mood and tone, capturing the parts the abridging author perceives to be most important; it could be a complete parody of the original; or it could fall anywhere in-between, either generally capturing the tone and message of the original author but falling short in some manner, or subtly twisting their words and message to favor a different interpretation or agenda
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Compare/contrast with epitome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A written work may be abridged to make it more accessible to a wider audience; for example, to make an adaptation of it as an audio book or a television show, to make a more convenient companion to an already established work, or to create a shorter reference version

John Warcup Cornforth, Jr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, AC, CBE, FRS, FAA (7 September 1917 – 8 December 2013) was an Australian–British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975 for his work on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalysed reactions, becoming the only Nobel laureate born in New South Wales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyse changes in organic compounds, the substrates, by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate's chains and rings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, Cornforth determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate were replaced by an enzyme to effect a given change in the substrate, allowing him to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For this work, he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975, alongside co-recipient Vladimir Prelog, and was knighted in 1977

Placental abruption, also known as abruptio placentae, is a complication of pregnancy, wherein the placental lining separates from the uterus of the mother prior to delivery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The effects on the mother depend primarily on the severity of the abruption, while the effects on the baby depend on both its severity and the gestational age at which it occurs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The heart rate of the baby is associated with the severity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Early medical intervention is needed to ensure a good outcome, and this is not available in many parts of the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Treatment depends on how serious the abruption is and how far along the woman is in her pregnancy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is the most common pathological cause of late pregnancy bleeding
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In humans, it refers to the abnormal separation after 20 weeks of gestation and prior to birth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It occurs on average in 0

Abruzzo (pronounced [aˈbruttso]) is a region of Italy in Southern Italy, with an area of 10,763 square km (4,156 sq mi) and a population of 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
3 million
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its western border lies 80 km (50 mi) east of Rome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The region is divided into the four provinces of L'Aquila, Teramo, Pescara, and Chieti
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abruzzo borders the region of Marche to the north, Lazio to the west and south-west, Molise to the south-east, and the Adriatic Sea to the east
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Geographically, Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area to the west, which includes the Gran Sasso D'italia, and a coastal area to the east with beaches on the Adriatic sea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abruzzo is considered culturally, linguistically, historically, and economically a region of Southern Italy, although geographically it may also be considered central
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Italian Statistical Authority (ISTAT) deems it to be part of Southern Italy, partially because of Abruzzo's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abruzzo is known as "the greenest region in Europe" as one third of its territory, the largest in Europe, is set aside as national parks and protected nature reserves: there are three national parks, one regional park, and 38 protected nature reserves
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These ensure the survival of 75% of Europe's living species including rare species, such as the small wading dotterel, golden eagle, the Abruzzo (or Abruzzese) chamois, Apennine wolf, and Marsican brown bear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abruzzo is also home to Calderone, Europe's southernmost glacier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Visiting nineteenth-century Italian diplomat and journalist Primo Levi (to not confuse with the writer and survivor of the Holocaust, Primo Levi) said that "forte e gentile" (strong and gentle) best describes the beauty of the region and the character of its people
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Forte e gentile" has since become the motto of the region and its inhabitants

An abscess (Latin: abscessus) is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles, with carbuncles being larger
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They are usually caused by a bacterial infection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like, and is confirmed by cutting it open
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics for this type of abscess in most people who are otherwise healthy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Skin abscesses are common, and have become more common in recent years
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as 65% in this population
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2005 in the United States, 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 with the condition

In mathematics, an abscissa (; plural abscissae or abscissæ or abscissas) is the number whose absolute value (modulus) is the perpendicular distance of a point from the vertical axis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Usually this is the horizontal coordinate of a point in a two-dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term can also refer to the horizontal axis (typically x-axis) of a two-dimensional graph (because that axis is used to define and measure the horizontal coordinates of points in the space)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An ordered pair consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually x) and the ordinate (vertical, usually y)—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space

Abscission (from the Latin ab, meaning away, and scindere, meaning to cut) is the shedding of various parts of an organism, such as a plant dropping a leaf, fruit, flower, or seed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In zoology, abscission is the intentional shedding of a body part, such as the shedding of a claw, husk, or the autotomy of a tail to evade a predator
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In mycology, it is the liberation of a fungal spore
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In cell biology, abscission refers to the separation of two daughter cells at the completion of cytokinesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression

Absent-mindedness is where a person shows inattentive or forgetful behaviour
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can have three different causes:
a low level of attention ("blanking" or "zoning out")
intense attention to a single object of focus (hyperfocus) that makes a person oblivious to events around him or her;
unwarranted distraction of attention from the object of focus by irrelevant thoughts or environmental events
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of attention and frequent distraction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a state people experience in their daily lives from a variety of different causes including boredom, sleepiness, or focus on internal thoughts instead of external surroundings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Traditionally, absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer; it was seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 More recent scholarship seeks to understand absenteeism as an indicator of psychological, medical, or social adjustment to work

Absinthe ( or ; French: [apsɛ̃t]) is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 proof) beverage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ("grand wormwood"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is commonly referred to in historical literature as "la fée verte" (the green fairy)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties (apart from that of the alcohol) have been exaggerated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, and the Czech Republic

In mathematical logic, a formula is said to be absolute if it has the same truth value in each of some class of structures (also called models)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Theorems about absoluteness typically establish relationships between the absoluteness of formulas and their syntactic form
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are two weaker forms of partial absoluteness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the truth of a formula in each substructure N of a structure M follows from its truth in M, the formula is downward absolute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the truth of a formula in a structure N implies its truth in each structure M extending N, the formula is upward absolute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Issues of absoluteness are particularly important in set theory and model theory, fields where multiple structures are considered simultaneously
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In model theory, several basic results and definitions are motivated by absoluteness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In set theory, the issue of which properties of sets are absolute is well studied
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Shoenfield absoluteness theorem, due to Joseph Shoenfield (1961), establishes the absoluteness of a large class of formulas between a model of set theory and its constructible universe, with important methodological consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The absoluteness of large cardinal axioms is also studied, with positive and negative results known

Absolver is a martial arts-focused action role-playing video game developed by Sloclap and published by Devolver Digital for PlayStation 4 and Windows
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the game, players control warrior characters who fight other players and computer-controlled characters across the fictional land of Adal to prove their worthiness of joining the Absolver peacekeepers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The game's story is focused on the human development of the characters as they fight to find their place in the collapsed empire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The character's fighting moves are customized in a "combat deck" of cards, with each card assigned to a move
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Players earn cards, equipment, and weapons by progressing through the game
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Sloclap, a Parisian indie game developer composed of former Ubisoft Paris employees, began work on Absolver in May 2015
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their core game concept was to have fluid, dynamic movement, similar to dance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The game debuted at the June 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released a year later, in August 2017

Publilius Syrus (fl
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 85–43 BC), was a Latin writer, best known for his sententiae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was a Syrian who was brought as a slave to Italy, but by his wit and talent he won the favour of his master, who freed and educated him
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Publilius' name, due to early medieval palatalization of 'l' between two 'i's, is often presented by manuscripts (and some printed editions) in corrupt form as 'Publius'
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Optical density" redirects here
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Optical density" can also refer to index of refraction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For use of the term "optical density" in molecular biology, see Nucleic acid quantitation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In chemistry, absorbance or decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material, and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absorbance is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The use of the term "optical density" for absorbance is discouraged
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In physics, a closely related quantity called "optical depth" is used instead of absorbance: the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The optical depth equals the absorbance times ln(10)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term absorption refers to the physical process of absorbing light, while absorbance does not always measure absorption: it measures attenuation (of transmitted radiant power)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Attenuation can be caused by absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Surface stress was first defined by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) as the amount of the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A suggestion is surface stress define as association with the amount of the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface instead of up definition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A similar term called “surface free energy”, which represents the excess free energy per unit area needed to create a new surface, is easily confused with “surface stress”
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although surface stress and surface free energy of liquid–gas or liquid–liquid interface are the same, they are very different in solid–gas or solid–solid interface, which will be discussed in details later
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since both terms represent a force per unit length, they have been referred to as “surface tension”, which contributes further to the confusion in the literature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In high energy physics experiments, an absorber is a block of material used to absorb some of the energy of an incident particle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absorbers can be made of a variety of materials, depending on the purpose; lead, tungsten and liquid hydrogen are common choices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most absorbers are used as part of a particle detector, particle accelerators use absorbers to reduce the radiation damage on accelerator components
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Absorbing Man (Carl "Crusher" Creel) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He first appeared in Journey into Mystery #114, cover dated March 1965, created by writer Stan Lee and writer/artist Jack Kirby
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over the years he has played a part on several Marvel Comics crossovers such as the original Secret Wars and Fear Itself
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Creel was given the power to take the form of any material he touched, "absorbing" the property of the material itself
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over the years the power has worked both for and against him, such as being turned into water, then mixed with dirt to become mud, or once when he became cocaine and had to reassemble himself
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Absorbing Man was given his powers by the Asgardian god Loki in a plot to defeat Loki's brother Thor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the Secret Wars storyline Creel became romantically involved with the super villain Titania and the two were linked for decades afterwards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the Fear Itself storyline, Creel comes into possession of a divine Asgardian hammer, granting him amplified powers and turning him into Greithoth: Breaker of Wills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated television series, video games, and merchandise such as trading cards

Certain words have been suggested to be inherently funny
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vaudeville tradition holds that words with the letter k are funny
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A 2015 study at the University of Alberta suggested that the humor of certain nonsense words can be explained by whether they seem rude or not and by the property of entropy – the improbability of certain letters being used together in a word
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated

Abstention is a term in election procedure for when a participant in a vote either does not go to vote (on election day) or, in parliamentary procedure, is present during the vote, but does not cast a ballot
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstention must be contrasted with "blank vote", in which a voter casts a ballot willfully made invalid by marking it wrongly or by not marking anything at all
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A "blank (or white) voter" has voted, although their vote may be considered a spoilt vote, depending on each legislation, while an abstaining voter hasn't voted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Both forms (abstention and blank vote) may or may not, depending on the circumstances, be considered to be a protest vote (also known as a "blank vote" or "white vote")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to his or her conscience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or has not participated in relevant discussion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In parliamentary procedure, a member may be required to abstain in the case of a real or perceived conflict of interest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abstentions do not count in tallying the vote negatively or positively; when members abstain, they are in effect attending only to contribute to a quorum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 White votes, however, may be counted in the total of votes, depending on the legislation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abstentionism is standing for election to a deliberative assembly while refusing to take up any seats won or otherwise participate in the assembly's business
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstentionism differs from an election boycott in that abstentionists participate in the election itself

 Abstentionism has been used by Irish republican political movements in the United Kingdom and Ireland since the early 19th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was also used by Hungarian and Czech nationalists in the Austrian Imperial Council in the 1860s

In psychology, a rush is an acute transcendent state of euphoria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Psychoactive drugs which enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) are commonly capable of such an event
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These drugs include opiates and opioids, such as heroin and morphine, and psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and cocaine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Intravenous injection is the fastest route of administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing)

The identity of the longest word in English depends upon the definition of what constitutes a word in the English language, as well as how length should be compared
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to words derived naturally from the language's roots (without any known intentional invention), English allows new words to be formed by coinage and construction; place names may be considered words; technical terms may be arbitrarily long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Length may be understood in terms of orthography and number of written letters, or (less commonly) phonology and the number of phonemes

Abstention is a term in election procedure for when a participant in a vote either does not go to vote (on election day) or, in parliamentary procedure, is present during the vote, but does not cast a ballot
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstention must be contrasted with "blank vote", in which a voter casts a ballot willfully made invalid by marking it wrongly or by not marking anything at all
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A "blank (or white) voter" has voted, although their vote may be considered a spoilt vote, depending on each legislation, while an abstaining voter hasn't voted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Both forms (abstention and blank vote) may or may not, depending on the circumstances, be considered to be a protest vote (also known as a "blank vote" or "white vote")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to his or her conscience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or has not participated in relevant discussion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In parliamentary procedure, a member may be required to abstain in the case of a real or perceived conflict of interest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abstentions do not count in tallying the vote negatively or positively; when members abstain, they are in effect attending only to contribute to a quorum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 White votes, however, may be counted in the total of votes, depending on the legislation

Assassin's Creed is a franchise centered on an action-adventure video game series developed by Ubisoft
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It depicts a centuries-old struggle pitting the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, against the Templars, who believe peace comes through control of humanity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The series features historical fiction mixed with real-world historical events and figures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The series took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The franchise began in 2007 with the release of Assassin's Creed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The main video game series consists of ten entries, developed by Ubisoft Montreal (single-player) and Ubisoft Annecy (multiplayer), released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Microsoft Windows, and OS X platforms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many spin-off games have been made for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, iOS, HP webOS, Android, Nokia Symbian and Windows Phone platforms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The handheld versions are developed by Gameloft and Gryptonite Studios, with additional development by Ubisoft Montreal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The series has been well received by critics, and has sold over 100 million copies as of September 2016, becoming Ubisoft's best selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The video game series has been expanded into a film, comics and novels; all of which take place within the same continuity as the main video games series

Abstinence is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most frequently, the term refers to sexual abstinence, or abstinence from alcohol or food
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The practice can arise from religious prohibitions and practical considerations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstinence may also refer to drugs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, one can abstain from smoking
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstinence has diverse forms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the twelve-step program of Overeaters Anonymous abstinence is the term for refraining from compulsive eating, akin in meaning to sobriety for alcoholics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities, "sublimation"

An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding, or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The terms précis or synopsis are used in some publications to refer to the same thing that other publications might call an "abstract"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In management reports, an executive summary usually contains more information (and often more sensitive information) than the abstract does

Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, eliminating the other characteristics of that particular ball
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In a type–token distinction, a type (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e

Abstractionism is the theory that the mind obtains some or all of its concepts by abstracting them from concepts it already has, or from experience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This view was criticized by George Berkeley and Peter Geach
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abstract art uses a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and nonrepresentational art are loosely related terms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abstraction exists along a continuum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contains partial abstraction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Both geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted

Obscurantism ( and ) is the practice of deliberately preventing the facts of some subject matter from becoming known
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are two historical and intellectual denotations of Obscurantism: (1) the deliberate restriction of knowledge—opposition to disseminating knowledge; and, (2) deliberate obscurity—an abstruse style (as in literature and art) characterized by deliberate vagueness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Therefore, an obscurantist is someone who actively opposes enlightenment and the consequent social reform, a type of anti-intellectual
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term obscurantism derives from the title of the 16th-century satire Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum (1515–19, Letters of Obscure Men), that was based upon the intellectual dispute between the German humanist Johann Reuchlin and the monk Johannes Pfefferkorn of the Dominican Order, about whether or not all Jewish books should be burned as un-Christian heresy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the Talmud (Jewish law and Jewish ethics) known to be in the Holy Roman Empire (AD 926–1806); the Letters of Obscure Men satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un–Christian" works
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the 18th century, Enlightenment philosophers applied the term obscurantist to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in metaphysics and theology from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and of modern philosophical skepticism, Friedrich Nietzsche said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence

An absurdity is a thing that is extremely unreasonable, so as to be foolish or not taken seriously, or the state of being so
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Absurd" is an adjective used to describe an absurdity, e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, "this encyclopedia article is absurd"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It derives from the Latin absurdum meaning "out of tune", hence irrational
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Latin surdus means "deaf", implying stupidity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absurdity is contrasted with seriousness in reasoning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In general usage, absurdity may be synonymous with ridiculousness and nonsense
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In specialized usage, absurdity is related to extremes in bad reasoning or pointlessness in reasoning; ridiculousness is related to extremes of incongruous juxtaposition, laughter, and ridicule; and nonsense is related to a lack of meaningfulness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absurdism is a concept in philosophy related to the notion of absurdity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In philosophy, "the Absurd" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this context absurd does not mean "logically impossible", but rather "humanly impossible"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accordingly, absurdism is a philosophical school of thought stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information as well as the vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with existentialism and nihilism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own existentialist philosophy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought and published his essay The Myth of Sisyphus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The aftermath of World War II provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of France

In logic, reductio ad absurdum (Latin for "reduction to absurdity"; or argumentum ad absurdum, "argument to absurdity") is a form of argument which attempts either to disprove a statement by showing it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or impractical conclusion, or to prove one by showing that if it were not true, the result would be absurd or impossible
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Traced back to classical Greek philosophy in Aristotle's Prior Analytics (Greek: ἡ Εις άτοπον απαγωγή, translit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 hê eis atopon apagôgê, lit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 'reduction to the impossible'), this technique has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Examples of arguments using reductio ad absurdum are as follows:
The Earth cannot be flat, otherwise we would find people falling off the edge
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There is no smallest positive rational number, because if there were, then it could be divided by two to get a smaller one
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first example shows that it would be absurd to argue that the Earth is flat, because it would lead to an outcome that is impossible since it contradicts laws of nature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The second example is a mathematical proof by contradiction directly bound to the mathematical concept of infinitesimals, which argues that the denial of the premise would result in a logical contradiction (there is a "smallest" number and yet there is a number smaller than it)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abudefduf also known as the sergeant-majors is a genus of fish in the family Pomacentridae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name is from Arabic abu, "the one with"; and def, "side", and the intensive plural ending -duf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name thus means "the one with prominent sides"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Abdullah or Abdallah is the primary transliteration of the Arabic given name, Arabic: عبد الله‎‎, built from the Arabic words Abd and Allah (Allah itself composed of Al- and Ilah)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The first letter a in Al-Ilah in its native pronunciation is often unstressed and commonly transliterated by u, a stressed a is often used as well, although any vowel can also be used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is one of many Arabic theophoric names, meaning servant of God or God's slave
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The feminine counterpart of this name is Amatullah

Humility before God is an essential value of Islam, hence Abdullah is a common name among Muslims
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In particular, the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's father was Abdullah
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is also common among Arab Jews, especially Iraqi Jews
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is cognate to and has the same meaning as the Hebrew Abdiel and, more commonly, Obadiah
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There were two Jewish Rabbis in Medina before Islam came; they were Abdullah ibn Salam and Abdullah ibn Shuria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Abdullah ibn Saba was a Yemenite Jew during the spread of Islam
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word Allah exists in the Arabic Talmud and other Jewish scriptures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The variant used in the Russian language is "Абдулла́" (Abdulla) (cf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Fedul, which has similar origins), with "Абду́л" (Abdul) and "Габдулла́" (Gabdulla) often used in Adyghe
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Christian Arabic Bible uses the word Allah for God
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Presently in the Middle East, the name is sometimes used by Christians, as a given or family name
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The continued use of this name is perhaps attributed to the passage in Matthew 25:14-30 which refers to the parable of talents and the three servants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The parable praises the good servants

Abelia  is a genus of about 30 species and many hybrids in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some authors, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, consider Abelia and related genera to belong instead in the segregate family Linnaeaceae, also including such genera as Linnaea, Abelia, Dipelta, Kolkwitzia, and Zabelia, but not such others as Lonicera or Symphoricarpos, included by them instead in a more narrowly viewed Caprifoliaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Abelias are shrubs from 1–6 m tall, native to eastern Asia (Japan west to the Himalaya) and southern North America (Mexico); the species from warm climates are evergreen, and colder climate species deciduous
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, ovate, glossy, dark green, 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5–8 cm long, turning purplish-bronze to red in autumn in the deciduous species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The flowers appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends, 1-8 together in a short cyme; they are pendulous, white to pink, bell-shaped with a five-lobed corolla, 1–5 cm long, and usually scented
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Flowering continues over a long and continuous period from late spring to fall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Type species of this genus is Abelia chinensis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The generic name commemorates Clarke Abel, a keen naturalist who accompanied Lord Amherst's unsuccessful embassy to China in 1816 as surgeon, under the sponsorship of Sir Joseph Banks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All of Abel's seeds and plants were lost in a shipwreck on the homeward voyage, however; living plants of Abelia chinensis were first imported to England in 1844 by Robert Fortune, who introduced A

Abun (in Europe erroneously known as Abuna, which is the status constructus form used when a name follows: Ge'ez አቡነ ’abuna/abune, 'our father'; Amharic and Tigrinya) is the honorific title used for any bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church as well as of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was historically used solely for the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Ethiopia during the more than 1000 years when the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria appointed only one bishop at a time to serve its Ethiopian flock
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When referred to without a name following, it is Abun, and if a name follows, it becomes Abuna

In number theory, an abundant number or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The integer 12 is the first abundant number
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the abundance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example

Premises are land and buildings together considered as a property
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This usage arose from property owners finding the word in their [title deed]s, where it originally correctly meant "the aforementioned; what this document is about", from [Latin] prae-missus = "placed before"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In this sense, the word is always used in the plural, but singular in construction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Note that a single house or a single other piece of property is "premises", not a "premise", although the word "premises" is plural in form; e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "The equipment is on the customer's premises", never "The equipment is on the customer's premise"

Abutilon  is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; in Russian, ornamental varieties are commonly known as the room maple
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The genus name is an 18th-century New Latin word that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون), the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In engineering, abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam whereon the structure's superstructure rests or contacts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Single-span bridges have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge, as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Dam abutments are generally either side of a valley or gorge but may be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch, or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The impost or abacus of a column in classical architecture may also serve as an abutment to an arch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The word derives from the verb "abut", meaning to "touch by means of a mutual border"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An abutter is a person (or entity) whose property is adjacent to the property of another
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In jurisdictions such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Nova Scotia, it is a defined legal term
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some jurisdictions, such as Virginia, may use the term adjacent landowner, while others, such as California, use the term adjoining landowner, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines rights of contiguous property owners (CPO)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


In land use regulations, concerns of an abutter may be given special attention, being the one most likely to suffer specific harm from a hasty, uninformed decision
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, a developer requesting a subdivision may be required to notify (or pay to notify) all abutters of the proposal and invite them to a public hearing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Regulations may also provide an abutter with the right to be heard at the hearing, unlike others who must request permission to be heard, at the discretion of the board
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the spirit of land use politics, even the unified voices of the concerned abutters may sound only faintly against the machinery of "progress" or well-funded special interests
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, the courts will objectively consider a proper case brought by an abutter whose rights have been arguably under-appreciated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Generally, the more abutters interested in a project, the more likely someone will object to it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some regulations otherwise expand or limit the participation of local owners, as where notice may be required for "anyone whose property is within 200 feet of any point of the parcel under consideration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" Another expansive definition would include those whose properties are across a public way or flowing waterway, where the parcels do not actually touch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Contrarily, regulations may define "abutter" to include only those people who hold record title to an adjacent parcel, thus undermining the rights of tenants, associations and partial owners (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, mineral rights and easement owners) to be notified, let alone heard on a proposal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This would also eliminate participation of owners of unrecorded title, such as adverse possession or those who have simply failed to record a deed or settle an estate involving the adjacent property

The abvolt (abV) is one option for the unit of potential difference in the EMU-CGS system of units, and is equal to 10−8 volts in the SI system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A potential difference of 1 abV will drive a current of one abampere through a resistance of one abohm
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In most practical applications, the volt and its multiples are preferred
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The national standard in the United States  deprecates the use of the abvolt, suggesting the use of volts instead
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The other option in the cgs system is the statvolt

The abyssal zone or abyssopelagic is a layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Abyss" derives from the Greek word ἄβυσσος, meaning bottomless
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These regions are also characterised by continuous cold and lack of nutrients
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The abyssal zone has temperatures around 2 °C to 3 °C (35 °F to 37 °F) through the large majority of its mass
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the deeper part of the midnight zone which starts in the bathypelagic waters above
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its permanent inhabitants (for example, Riftia pachyptila, (the giant tube worm)) found near hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean and the giant squid are able to withstand the immense pressures of the ocean depths, up to 76 megapascals (11,000 psi)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The area below the abyssal zone is the sparsely inhabited hadal zone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The zone above is the bathyal zone

Acadia (French: Acadie) was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies that became Canadian provinces and American states
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, Acadians)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two communities intermarried, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first capital of Acadia, established in 1605, was Port-Royal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A British force from Virginia attacked and burned down the town in 1613, but it was later rebuilt nearby, where it remained the longest serving capital of French Acadia until the British Siege of Port Royal in 1710
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over seventy-four years there were six colonial wars, in which English and later British interests tried to capture Acadia starting with King William's War in 1689
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During these wars, along with some French troops from Quebec, some Acadians, the Wabanaki Confederacy, and French priests continuously raided New England settlements along the border in Maine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While Acadia was officially conquered in 1710 during Queen Anne's War, present-day New Brunswick and much of Maine remained contested territory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Present-day Prince Edward Island (Île Saint-Jean) and Cape Breton (Île Royale) as agreed under Article XIII of the Treaty of Utrecht remained under French control
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By militarily defeating the Wabanaki Confederacy and the French priests, present-day Maine fell during Father Rale's War
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During King George's War, France and New France made significant attempts to regain mainland Nova Scotia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After Father Le Loutre's War, present-day New Brunswick fell to the British
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Finally, during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), both Île Royale and Île Saint-Jean fell to the British in 1758
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Today, the term Acadia is used to refer to regions of North America that are historically associated with the lands, descendants, and/or culture of the former French region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It particularly refers to regions of The Maritimes with French roots, language, and culture, primarily in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island, as well as in Maine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can also be used to refer to the Acadian diaspora in southern Louisiana, a region also referred to as Acadiana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the abstract, Acadia refers to the existence of a French culture in any of these regions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

People living in Acadia, and sometimes former residents and their descendants, are called Acadians, also later known as Cajuns after resettlement in Louisiana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Acadians (French: Acadiens, IPA: [akadjɛ̃]) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada's Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although today most of the Acadians and Québécois are French-speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a result, the Acadians and Québécois developed two distinct histories and cultures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They also developed a slightly different French language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 France has one official language and to accomplish this they have an administration in charge of the language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since the Acadians were separated from this council, their French language evolved independently, and Acadians retain several elements of 17th-century French that have been lost in France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France, but especially regions such as Île-de-France, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou and Aquitaine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acadian family names have come from many areas in France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the Maillets are from Paris; the LeBlancs of Normandy; the surname Melanson is from Brittany, and those with the surnames Bastarache and Basque came from Aquitaine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

During the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), British colonial officers suspected Acadians were aligned with France after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beausejour
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians during the 1755–1764 period
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The result was what one historian described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other historians indicate that it was a deportation similar to other deportations of the time period
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most Acadians were deported to various American colonies, where many were forced into servitude, or marginal lifestyles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some Acadians were deported to England, sent to the Caribbean, and some were deported to France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to present day Louisiana state (known then as Spanish colonial Luisiana), where they developed what became known as Cajun culture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick because they were barred by the British from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Before the US Revolutionary War, the Crown settled New England Planters in former Acadian communities and farmland as well as, after the war, Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 Black Loyalists, who were freed slaves)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 British policy was to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acadians speak a dialect of French called Acadian French
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many of those in the Moncton area speak Chiac and English
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Louisiana Cajun descendants speak a dialect of American English called Cajun English, with several also speaking Cajun French, a close relative of the original dialect from Canada influenced by Spanish and West African languages

 It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The genus name Acalypha is from the Greek ακαλεφης, akalephes ("nettle"), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 General common names include copperleaf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus is distributed mainly in the tropics and subtropics, with about 60% of species native to the Americas and about 30% in Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthaceae is a family (the acanthus family) of dicotyledonous flowering plants containing almost 250 genera and about 2500 species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most are tropical herbs, shrubs, or twining vines; some are epiphytes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Only a few species are distributed in temperate regions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The four main centres of distribution are Indonesia and Malaysia, Africa, Brazil, and Central America
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The representatives of the family can be found in nearly every habitat, including dense or open forests, scrublands, wet fields and valleys, sea coast and marine areas, swamps, and mangrove forests
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The rifleman (Acanthisitta chloris) (Māori: tītipounamu) is a small insectivorous passerine bird that is endemic to New Zealand
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It belongs to the Acanthisittidae family, also known as the New Zealand wrens, of which it is one of only two surviving species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The rifleman resembles a wren in form, but is not related to the family of true wrens, Troglodytidae, nor the fairy-wrens of Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The rifleman is named after a colonial New Zealand regiment because its plumage drew similarities with the military uniform of a rifleman
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthocephala (Greek ἄκανθος, akanthos, thorn + κεφαλή, kephale, head) is a phylum of parasitic worms known as acanthocephalans, thorny-headed worms, or spiny-headed worms, characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis, armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the gut wall of its host
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, involving at least two hosts, which may include invertebrates, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
  About 1150 species have been described
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Acanthocephala were thought to be a discrete phylum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Recent genome analysis has shown that they are descended from, and should be considered as, highly modified rotifers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This finding is an example of molecular phylogenetics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This unified taxon is known as Syndermata

Acanthocereus is a genus of cacti
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its species take the form of shrubs with arching or climbing stems up to several meters in height
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The generic name is derived from the Greek word άκανθα (acantha), meaning spine, and the Latin word cereus, meaning candle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The six species occur in the tropical Americas from the southern tip of Florida to Colombia, including islands of the Caribbean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Stems have 3 to 5 ribs, typically thin, with stout spines
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The pretty white funnel-shaped flowers are night-opening, 12–25 cm (4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7–9
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8 in) long and 6–12 cm (2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4–4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 in) in diameter
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Acanthocereus tetragonus, commonly known as Barbed-wire Cactus, Chaco, Nun-tsusuy, or Órgano, is the most widespread of the genus and the largest, reaching 2–7 m (6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
6–23
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0 ft) tall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name was first used by George Engelmann in 1863, although he did not describe its characters, leaving it to Alwin Berger in 1905 to define it as a subsection of Cereus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1909, Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose elevated Acanthocereus to a genus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) is a scombrid fish found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is best known to sports fishermen, as its speed and high-quality flesh make it a prize game fish
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Hawaii, the wahoo is known as ono
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many Hispanic areas of the Caribbean and Central America refer to this fish as peto
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The flesh of the wahoo is white to grey, delicate to dense, and highly regarded by many gourmets
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The taste has been said to be similar to mackerel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This has created some demand for the wahoo as a premium-priced commercial food fish
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many areas of its range, such as Hawaii, Bermuda and many parts of the Caribbean, local demand for wahoo is met by artisanal commercial fishermen, who take them primarily by trolling, as well as by recreational sports fishermen who sell their catch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthocyte (from the Greek word ἄκανθα acantha, meaning 'thorn'), in biology and medicine, refers to a form of red blood cell that has a spiked cell membrane, due to abnormal thorny projections
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A similar term is spur cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Often they may be confused with echinocytes or schistocytes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acanthocytes have coarse, weirdly spaced, variably sized crenations, resembling many-pointed stars
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are seen on blood films in, among others abetalipoproteinemia, liver disease, chorea acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome, and several inherited neurological and other disorders, such as neuroacanthocytosis, anorexia nervosa, infantile pyknocytosis, hypothyroidism, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, alcoholism, congestive splenomegaly, Zieve syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease

Acanthosis is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale and stratum spinosum)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acantholysis is the loss of intercellular connections, such as desmosomes, resulting in loss of cohesion between keratinocytes, seen in diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is absent in bullous pemphigoid, making it useful for differential diagnosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This histological feature is also seen in herpes simplex infections (HSV 1 and 2) and varicella zoster infections (chicken pox and shingles)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acanthoma is a skin neoplasm composed of squamous or epidermal cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is located in the prickle cell layer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Types of acanthoma include pilar sheath acanthoma, a benign follicular tumor usually of the upper lip; clear cell acanthoma, a benign tumor found most frequently on the legs; and Degos acanthoma, often confused with but unrelated to Degos disease
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthophis is a genus of elapid snakes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Commonly called death adders, they are native to Australia, New Guinea and nearby islands, and are among the most venomous snakes in the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name of the genus derives from the Ancient Greek acanthos/ἄκανθος "spine" and ophis/ὄφις "snake", referring to the spine on the death adder's tail
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Seven species are listed by ITIS, though it remains unclear how many species this genus includes, with figures ranging from 4 to 15 species being quoted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthopterygii (meaning "spiny finned one") is a superorder of bony fishes in the class Actinopterygii
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Members of this superorder are sometimes called ray-finned fishes for the characteristic sharp, bony rays in their fins; however this name is often given to the class Actinopterygii as a whole
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthoscelides is a genus of bean weevils of the subfamily Bruchinae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are native to the New World
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 About one third of them can be found in Mexico
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1946 this genus was populated with at least 322 species transferred from other genera, mainly Bruchus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of these were later placed into other genera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Estimates of the current number of named species range from about 300 to 340, and there are over 200 undescribed species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These beetles are generally 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
1 to 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 millimeters long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have large, protruding eyes, and males often have larger eyes than females
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They sometimes also have longer antennae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The elytra are about twice as long as they are wide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The beetles of this genus are diverse and the characters used to classify them are not well defined; historically, Acanthoscelides is a wastebasket taxon, "used as a genus into which species are placed that do not fit within the limits of other genera"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most of these beetles feed on legumes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The majority specialize on Faboideae, many on Mimosoideae, and fewer on Caesalpinioideae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some are known from non-legume host plants, such as mallows
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Familiar species include Acanthoscelides obtectus, a worldwide pest of beans, and Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus, which is employed as an agent of biological pest control against the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Species include:
Acanthoscelides aequalis
Acanthoscelides alboscutellatus
Acanthoscelides atomus

Acanthosis is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale and stratum spinosum)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthosis nigricans is a brown to black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is usually found in body folds, such as the posterior and lateral folds of the neck, the armpits, groin, navel, forehead, and other areas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthuridae is the family of surgeonfishes, tangs, and unicornfishes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family includes about 86 extant species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family is composed of marine fish living in tropical seas, usually around coral reefs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many of the species are brightly colored and popular for aquaria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The distinctive characteristic of the family is the scalpel-like spines, one or more on either side of the tail ("thorn tails"), which are dangerously sharp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are large, extending for most of the length of the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The small mouths have a single row of teeth used for grazing on algae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Surgeonfishes sometimes feed as solitary individuals, but they also often travel and feed in schools
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Feeding in schools may be a mechanism for overwhelming the highly aggressive defense responses of small territorial damselfishes that vigorously guard small patches of algae on coral reefs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most species are relatively small and have a maximum length of 15–40 cm (6–15
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 in), but some members of the genus Acanthurus, some members of the genus Prionurus, and most members of the genus Naso can grow larger, with the whitemargin unicornfish (N
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 annulatus), the largest species in the family, reaching a length of up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These fishes can grow quickly in aquaria, so average growth size and suitability should be checked before adding them to a marine aquarium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acanthurus is a genus of fish in the family Acanthuridae found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are found in tropical oceans, especially near coral reefs, with most species in the Indo-Pacific but a few are found in the Atlantic Ocean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As other members of the family, they have a pair of spines, one on either side of the base of the tail which are dangerously sharp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actinism () is the property of solar radiation that leads to the production of photochemical and photobiological effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinism is derived from the Greek ακτίς, ακτῖνος (a ray or beam)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word actinism is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and chemistry (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in chemical photography and X-ray imaging
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actinic () chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acapulco de Juárez (Spanish: [akaˈpulko de ˈxwaɾes]), commonly called Acapulco, is a city, municipality and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s throu 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acapulco is still famous and still attracts many tourists, although most are now from Mexico itself
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyong is the "traditional" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagao through the Zocalo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as "Zona Dorada" (golden zone in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end "Diamante" (diamond in Spanish) which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name "Acapulco" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-pōl-co, and means "where the reeds were destroyed or washed away"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The "de Juárez" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Juárez, former President of Mexico (1806–1872)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul was the western end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to what was then a Spanish colony
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acadia (French: Acadie) was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies that became Canadian provinces and American states
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, Acadians)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two communities intermarried, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first capital of Acadia, established in 1605, was Port-Royal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A British force from Virginia attacked and burned down the town in 1613, but it was later rebuilt nearby, where it remained the longest serving capital of French Acadia until the British Siege of Port Royal in 1710
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over seventy-four years there were six colonial wars, in which English and later British interests tried to capture Acadia starting with King William's War in 1689
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During these wars, along with some French troops from Quebec, some Acadians, the Wabanaki Confederacy, and French priests continuously raided New England settlements along the border in Maine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While Acadia was officially conquered in 1710 during Queen Anne's War, present-day New Brunswick and much of Maine remained contested territory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Present-day Prince Edward Island (Île Saint-Jean) and Cape Breton (Île Royale) as agreed under Article XIII of the Treaty of Utrecht remained under French control
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By militarily defeating the Wabanaki Confederacy and the French priests, present-day Maine fell during Father Rale's War
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During King George's War, France and New France made significant attempts to regain mainland Nova Scotia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After Father Le Loutre's War, present-day New Brunswick fell to the British
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Finally, during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), both Île Royale and Île Saint-Jean fell to the British in 1758
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Today, the term Acadia is used to refer to regions of North America that are historically associated with the lands, descendants, and/or culture of the former French region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It particularly refers to regions of The Maritimes with French roots, language, and culture, primarily in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island, as well as in Maine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can also be used to refer to the Acadian diaspora in southern Louisiana, a region also referred to as Acadiana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the abstract, Acadia refers to the existence of a French culture in any of these regions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

People living in Acadia, and sometimes former residents and their descendants, are called Acadians, also later known as Cajuns after resettlement in Louisiana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Juliette, or Key of Dreams (French: Juliette ou La clef des songes) is a 1951 French drama film directed by Marcel Carné
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was entered into the 1951 Cannes Film Festival
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The film is based on a play by Georges Neveux

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acaricides are pesticides that kill members of the arachnid subclass Acari, which includes ticks and mites
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acaricides are used both in medicine and agriculture, although the desired selective toxicity differs between the two fields
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acacia, commonly known as the wattles or acacias, is a large genus of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Initially it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa and Australia, with the first species A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 nilotica described by Linnaeus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Controversy erupted in the early 2000s when it became evident that the genus as it stood was not monophyletic, and that several divergent lineages needed to be placed in separate genera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It turned out that one lineage comprising over 900 species mainly native to Australia was not closely related to the mainly African lineage that contained A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 nilotica—the first and type species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This meant that the Australian lineage (by far the most prolific in number of species) would need to be renamed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Botanist Les Pedley named this group Racosperma, which was inconsistently adopted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Australian botanists proposed that this would be more disruptive than setting a different type species (A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 penninervis) and allowing this large number of species to remain Acacia, resulting in the two African lineages being renamed Vachellia and Senegalia, and the two New World lineages renamed Acaciella and Mariosousa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This was officially adopted, but many botanists from Africa and elsewhere disagreed that this was necessary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A number of species have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The heterogeneous group varies considerably in habit, from mat-like subshrubs to canopy trees in forest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Acaridae are a family of mites
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common forms include some mold mites, for example the grain mite
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Genera in the family include:
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Acadians (French: Acadiens, IPA: [akadjɛ̃]) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada's Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although today most of the Acadians and Québécois are French-speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a result, the Acadians and Québécois developed two distinct histories and cultures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They also developed a slightly different French language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 France has one official language and to accomplish this they have an administration in charge of the language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since the Acadians were separated from this council, their French language evolved independently, and Acadians retain several elements of 17th-century French that have been lost in France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France, but especially regions such as Île-de-France, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou and Aquitaine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acadian family names have come from many areas in France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the Maillets are from Paris; the LeBlancs of Normandy; the surname Melanson is from Brittany, and those with the surnames Bastarache and Basque came from Aquitaine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

During the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), British colonial officers suspected Acadians were aligned with France after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beausejour
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians during the 1755–1764 period
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The result was what one historian described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other historians indicate that it was a deportation similar to other deportations of the time period
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most Acadians were deported to various American colonies, where many were forced into servitude, or marginal lifestyles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some Acadians were deported to England, sent to the Caribbean, and some were deported to France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to present day Louisiana state (known then as Spanish colonial Luisiana), where they developed what became known as Cajun culture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick because they were barred by the British from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Before the US Revolutionary War, the Crown settled New England Planters in former Acadian communities and farmland as well as, after the war, Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 Black Loyalists, who were freed slaves)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 British policy was to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled

Acari (or Acarina) are a taxon of arachnids that contains mites and ticks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The diversity of the Acari is extraordinary and its fossil history goes back to at least the early Devonian period
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a result, acarologists (the people who study mites and ticks) have proposed a complex set of taxonomic ranks to classify mites
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In most modern treatments, the Acari is considered a subclass of Arachnida and is composed of two or three superorders or orders: Acariformes (or Actinotrichida), Parasitiformes (or Anactinotrichida), and Opilioacariformes; the latter is often considered a subgroup within the Parasitiformes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The monophyly of the Acari is open to debate, and the relationships of the acarines to other arachnids is not at all clear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In older treatments, the subgroups of the Acarina were placed at order rank, but as their own subdivisions have become better understood, it is more usual to treat them at superorder rank
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most acarines are minute to small (e

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over 50,000 species have been described (as of 1999) and it is estimated that a million or more species may exist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The study of mites and ticks is called acarology (from Greek ἀκαρί/ἄκαρι, akari, a type of mite; and -λογία, -logia), and the leading scientific journals for acarology include Acarologia, Experimental and Applied Acarology and the International Journal of Acarology

Acarus is a genus of mites in the family Acaridae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acatalectic line of verse is one having the metrically complete number of syllables in the final foot
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When talking about poetry written in English the term is arguably of limited significance or utility, at least by comparison to its antonym, catalectic, for the simple reason that acatalexis is considered to be the "usual case" in the large majority of metrical contexts and therefore explicit reference to it proves almost universally superfluous
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

For example, to describe Shakespeare's sonnets as having been written in iambic pentameter acatalectic would be factually accurate, but redundant and never said, because iambic pentameter is presumed to be acatalectic unless specified as being catalectic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, in very rare contexts where catalexis might be considered probable (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, in English trochaic tetrameter, or in differentiating acatalectic verses from surrounding catalectic ones), explicit expression of the verse's metrical completeness may be achieved by using the term
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When talking about poems published in languages other than English, the term might prove itself more useful
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example in Polish poetry acatalectic iambic lines are unusual, because feminine ending is dominant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thus iambic pentameter in Polish is not 10-syllable long but almost always 11-syllable long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acathexis is a psychoanalytic term for a lack of emotional response to significant memories or actual interactions, where such a response would normally be expected
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term also refers more broadly to a general absence of normal or expected feelings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acathexis has been linked to anxiety, bipolar disorder and dementia, while the phenomenon also appears in posttraumatic stress disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accuracy has two definitions:
More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; as these cause a difference between a result and a "true" value, ISO calls this trueness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Alternatively, ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In simplest terms, given a set of data points from a series of measurements, the set can be said to be precise if the values are close to the average value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be accurate if the values are close to the true value of the quantity being measured
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither

Accelerando is a 2005 science fiction novel consisting of a series of interconnected short stories written by British author Charles Stross
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As well as normal hardback and paperback editions, it was released as a free e-book under the CC BY-NC-ND license
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accelerando won the Locus Award in 2006, and was nominated for several other awards in 2005 and 2006, including the Hugo, Campbell, Clarke, and British Science Fiction Association Awards

Accelerated Reader (AR) is software for K-12 schools for monitoring the practice of reading
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was created by Renaissance Learning, Inc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are two versions: a desktop version and a web-based version in Renaissance Place, the company's online portal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acceleration, in physics, is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newton's Second Law
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m s−2)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accelerations are vector quantities (they have magnitude and direction) and add according to the parallelogram law
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a vector, the calculated net force is equal to the product of the object's mass (a scalar quantity) and its acceleration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the car turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new-direction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this example, we can call the forward acceleration of the car a "linear acceleration", which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When changing direction, we might call this "non-linear acceleration", which passengers might experience as a sideways force
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called deceleration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them forwards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration: both are changes in velocity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) matches that of the car

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Proper acceleration, being the acceleration (or rate of change of velocity) of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame, is not the same as coordinate acceleration, being the acceleration in a fixed coordinate system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to Earth's gravity, straight upwards (by definition) of g ≈ 9
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
81 m/s2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By contrast, accelerometers in free fall (falling toward the center of the Earth at a rate of about 9
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
81 m/s2) will measure zero
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accelerometers have multiple applications in industry and science
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Highly sensitive accelerometers are components of inertial navigation systems for aircraft and missiles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accelerometers are used to detect and monitor vibration in rotating machinery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accelerometers are used in tablet computers and digital cameras so that images on screens are always displayed upright
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accelerometers are used in drones for flight stabilisation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Coordinated accelerometers can be used to measure differences in proper acceleration, particularly gravity, over their separation in space; i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, gradient of the gravitational field
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This gravity gradiometry is useful because absolute gravity is a weak effect and depends on local density of the Earth which is quite variable
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Single- and multi-axis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration, as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes), coordinate acceleration, vibration, shock, and falling in a resistive medium (a case where the proper acceleration changes, since it starts at zero, then increases)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Micromachined accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices and video game controllers, to detect the position of the device or provide for game input
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A diacritic – also diacritical mark, diacritical point, or diacritical sign – is a glyph added to a letter, or basic glyph
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term derives from the Ancient Greek διακριτικός (diakritikós, "distinguishing"), from διακρίνω (diakrī́nō, "to distinguish")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diacritic is primarily an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ), are often called accents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Examples are the diaereses in the borrowed French words naïve and Noël, which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in saké and poetic breathèd; and the cedilla under the "c" in the borrowed French word façade, which shows it is pronounced /s/ rather than /k/
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other Latin-script alphabets, they may distinguish between homonyms, such as the French là ("there") versus la ("the") that are both pronounced /la/
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Gaelic type, a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In other alphabetic systems, diacritical marks may perform other functions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vowel pointing systems, namely the Arabic harakat ( ـِ ,ـُ ,ـَ, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) and the Hebrew niqqud ( ַ◌, ֶ◌, ִ◌, ֹ◌, ֻ◌, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Indic virama ( ् etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) and the Arabic sukūn ( ـْـ ) mark the absence of vowel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cantillation marks indicate prosody
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo ( ◌҃ ) and the Hebrew gershayim ( ״ ), which, respectively, mark abbreviations or acronyms, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In orthography and collation, a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In some cases, letters are used as "in-line diacritics", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the "h" in the English pronunciation of "sh" and "th"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The accentors are a genus of birds in the family Prunellidae, which is the only bird family endemic to the Palearctic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This small group of closely related passerines are all in the genus Prunella
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All but the dunnock and the Japanese accentor are inhabitants of the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia; these two also occur in lowland areas, as does the Siberian accentor in the far north of Siberia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These birds are not strongly migratory, but they will leave the coldest parts of their range in winter and make altitudinal movements
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Accentual verse has a fixed number of stresses per line regardless of the number of syllables that are present
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is common in languages that are stress-timed, such as English, as opposed to syllabic verse which is common in syllable-timed languages, such as French
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In linguistics, and particularly phonology, stress or accent is relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word, or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This emphasis is typically caused by such properties as increased loudness and vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and changes in pitch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The terms stress and accent are often used synonymously in this context, but they are sometimes distinguished, with accent being more strictly sound-based (auditory)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, when emphasis is produced through pitch alone, it is called pitch accent, and when produced through length alone, it is called quantitative accent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When caused by a combination of various intensified properties, it is called stress accent or dynamic accent; English uses what is called variable stress accent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The stress placed on syllables within words is called word stress or lexical stress
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some languages have fixed stress, meaning that the stress on virtually any multisyllable word falls on a particular syllable, such as the first or the penultimate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other languages, like English, have variable stress, where the position of stress in a word is not predictable in that way
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sometimes more than one level of stress, such as primary stress and secondary stress, may be identified
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, some languages, such as French and Mandarin, are sometimes analyzed as lacking lexical stress entirely
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The stress placed on words within sentences is called sentence stress or prosodic stress
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is one of the three components of prosody, along with rhythm and intonation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It includes phrasal stress (the default emphasis of certain words within phrases or clauses), and contrastive stress (used to highlight an item − a word, or occasionally just part of a word − that is given particular focus)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Overton window, also known as the window of discourse, is the range of ideas the public will accept
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is used by media pundits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term is derived from its originator, Joseph P
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Overton (1960–2003), a former vice president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, who in his description of his window claimed that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within the window, rather than on politicians' individual preferences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to Overton's description, his window includes a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep public office
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Overton described a spectrum from "more free" to "less free" with regard to government intervention, oriented vertically on an axis, to avoid comparison with the left-right political spectrum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As the spectrum moves or expands, an idea at a given location may become more or less politically acceptable
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Political commentator Joshua Treviño postulated that the degrees of acceptance of public ideas are roughly:
Unthinkable
Radical
Acceptable
Sensible
Popular
Policy
The Overton window is an approach to identifying which ideas define the domain of acceptability within a democracy's possible governmental policies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Proponents of policies outside the window seek to persuade or educate the public in order to move and/or expand the window
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Proponents of current policies, or similar ones, within the window seek to convince people that policies outside it should be deemed unacceptable
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

After Overton's death, others have examined the concept of adjusting the window by the deliberate promotion of ideas outside of it, or "outer fringe" ideas, with the intention of making less fringe ideas acceptable by comparison
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The "door-in-the-face" technique of persuasion is similar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acceptance in human psychology is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it or protest it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept is close in meaning to acquiescence, derived from the Latin acquiēscere (to find rest in)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities, or special needs, or enabling access through the use of assistive technology; however, research and development in accessibility brings benefits to everyone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accessibility is not to be confused with usability, which is the extent to which a product (such as a device, service, or environment) can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accessibility is strongly related to universal design which is the process of creating products that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is about making things accessible to all people (whether they have a disability or not)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In music, ornaments or embellishments are musical flourishes, typically added notes, that are not essential to carry the overall line of the melody (or harmony), but serve instead to decorate or "ornament" that line (or harmony), provide added interest and variety, and give the performer the opportunity to add expressiveness to a song or piece
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many ornaments are performed as "fast notes" around a central, main note
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short grace note before a main note to the performance of a virtuostic and flamboyant trill
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The amount of ornamentation in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the Baroque period, from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word agrément is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the Baroque period, it was common for performers to improvise ornamentation on a given melodic line
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A singer performing a da capo aria, for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time, but decorate it with additional flourishes and trills the second time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Similarly, a harpsichord player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, mordents and appoggiaturas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Ornamentation may also be indicated by the composer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in music notation, while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as full-sized notes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A grace note is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its note value does not count as part of the total time value of the bar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see Appoggiatura, below), or in association with some other ornament's indication (see Trill, below), regardless of the timing used in the execution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In Spain, melodies ornamented upon repetition ("divisions") were called "diferencias", and can be traced back to 1538, when Luis de Narváez published the first collection of such music for the vihuela

An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental, and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015)

The Accidentals are an American musical band, formed in Traverse City, Michigan, United States in 2012, by Savannah Buist and Katie Larson
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Currently the band includes the founders and musician Michael Dause, added in 2014
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The group features an eclectic blend of indie folk, pop, jazz, bluegrass, rock, classical and other genres, utilizing a wide variety of instruments that reflect the group's orchestral roots and electronic influences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The band released two full length albums and an EP between 2012 and 2016
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In March 2015, they performed at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, which featured some 2,200 acts, and were named as one of the top breakout groups by Billboard staff
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 2015, the group joined forces with the singer-songwriter-producer Marshall Crenshaw and Grammy Award-winning producer Stewart Lerman, to produce four new albums
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Upon the contract becoming renegotiable, the band opted to continue releasing music independently in 2016

Re·ac·tor is the eleventh studio album by Canadian musician Neil Young, and his fourth with Crazy Horse, released in 1981
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The album combined the electric guitar-focused approach that Young took in his late 1970s records with Crazy Horse sound with early 1980s new wave rhythms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Critical reception to the album was generally poor except for the accolades accorded to the album closer "Shots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" The album marked the first use by Young of the Synclavier which would be featured heavily on several of his later albums: Trans (1982) and Landing on Water (1986)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The album features the Serenity Prayer on its back cover ("'Deus dona mihi serenitatem accipere res quae non possum mutare fortitudinem mutare res quae possum atque sapientiam differentiam cognoscere'" – "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It was unavailable on compact disc until it was released as a HDCD-encoded remastered version on August 19, 2003 as part of the Neil Young Archives Digital Masterpiece Series

Accipiter is a genus of birds of prey in the family Accipitridae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most species are called goshawks or sparrowhawks, although all New World species are simply known as hawks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They can be anatomically distinguished from their relatives by the lack of a procoracoid foramen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two small and aberrant species usually placed here do possess a large procoracoid foramen and are also distinct as regards DNA sequence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They may warrant separation in the old genus Hieraspiza
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Extant accipiters range in size from the little sparrowhawk (A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 minullus), in which the smallest males measure 20 cm (7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
9 in) long, span 39 cm (15 in) across the wings and weigh 68 g (2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4 oz), to the northern goshawk (A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 gentilis), in which the largest females measure 64 cm (25 in) long, span 127 cm (50 in) across the wings, and weigh 2,200 g (4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
9 lb)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These birds are slender with short, broad, rounded wings and a long tail which helps them maneuver in flight
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have long legs and long, sharp talons used to kill their prey, and a sharp, hooked bill used in feeding
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Females tend to be larger than males
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They often ambush their prey, mainly small birds and mammals, capturing them after a short chase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The typical flight pattern is a series of flaps followed by a short glide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are commonly found in wooded or shrubby areas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus Accipiter was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is Latin for "hawk", from accipere, "to grasp"

The Accipitridae, one of the four families within the order Accipitriformes (the others being Cathartidae, Pandionidae and Sagittariidae), are a family of small to large birds with strongly hooked bills and variable morphology based on diet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They feed on a range of prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals, with a number feeding on carrion and a few feeding on fruit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some species are migratory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Many well-known birds, such as hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures are included in this group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The osprey is usually placed in a separate family (Pandionidae), as is the secretary bird (Sagittariidae), and the New World vultures are also usually now regarded as a separate family or order
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Karyotype data indicate the accipitrids analysed are indeed a distinct monophyletic group, but whether this group should be considered a family or one or several order(s) on their own is a question still to be resolved
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Accipitriformes are an order that includes most of the diurnal birds of prey: hawks, eagles, vultures, and many others, about 225 species in all
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For a long time, the majority view has been to include them with the falcons in the Falconiformes, but many authorities have recognized a separate Accipitriformes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2008, a recent DNA study indicated that falcons are not closely related to the Accipitriformes, being instead related to parrots and passerines
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Since then, the split and the placement of the falcons next to the parrots in taxonomic order has been adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union's South American Classification Committee (SACC), its North American Classification Committee (NACC), and the International Ornithological Congress (IOC)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The British Ornithologists' Union already recognized the Accipitriformes, and has adopted the move of Falconiformes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The DNA-based proposal and the NACC and IOC classifications include the New World vultures in the Accipitriformes, while the SACC classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the Cathartiformes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The latter view has been adopted here
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Accipitrinae are the subfamily of the Accipitridae often known as the "true" hawks, including all members of Accipiter and the closely related genera Melierax, Urotriorchis, Erythrotriorchis and Megatriorchis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The large and widespread genus Accipiter includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, the sharp-shinned hawk and others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are primarily woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch, with long tails, broad wings and high visual acuity facilitating this lifestyle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In light of recent genetic research, the kites of the traditional subfamily Milvinae may also belong to this group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Hawks, including the accipitrines, are believed to have vision several times sharper than humans, in part because of the great number of photoreceptor cells in their retinas (up to 1,000,000 per square mm, against 200,000 for humans), a very high number of nerves connecting the receptors to the brain, and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central portion of the visual field

is the title of a music recording released on compact disc in early 2004 by Virgin Classics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a performance of 17th century Italian music selected by the conductor, Jean Tubéry to have been influential in French culture at the time of Cardinal Mazarin, a 17th-century chief minister of France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The music is performed by the countertenor Philippe Jaroussky, along with the instrumentalists of Ensemble La Fenice

An acclamation, in its most common sense, is a form of election that does not use a ballot
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Acclamation" or "acclamatio" can also signify a kind of ritual greeting and expression of approval in certain social contexts as in ancient Rome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acclimatization or acclimatisation (also called acclimation or acclimatation) is the process in which an individual organism adjusts to a change in its environment (such as a change in altitude, temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH), allowing it to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acclimatization occurs in a short period of time (hours to weeks), and within the organism's lifetime (compared to adaptation, which is a development that takes place over many generations)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This may be a discrete occurrence (for example, when mountaineers acclimate to high altitude over hours or days) or may instead represent part of a periodic cycle, such as a mammal shedding heavy winter fur in favor of a lighter summer coat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Organisms can adjust their morphological, behavioral, physical, and/or biochemical traits in response to changes in their environment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While the capacity to acclimate to novel environments has been well documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate the way that they do

Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the "beat" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Alternatively, the accompaniment to a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be provided by a musical ensemble, ranging in size from a duo (e

, a string quartet in Classical music can accompany a solo singer; a rock band or rhythm section in rock and pop; a jazz quartet in jazz); all the way to larger ensembles, such as concert bands, Big Bands (in jazz), pit orchestras in musical theatre; and orchestras, which, in addition to playing symphonies, can also provide accompaniment to a concerto solo instrumentalist or to solo singers in opera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 With choral music, the accompaniment to a vocal solo can be provided by other singers in the choir, who sing harmony parts or countermelodies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accompaniment parts range from so simple that a beginner can play them (e

Under the English common law, an accomplice is a person who actively participates in the commission of a crime, even if they take no part in the actual criminal offense
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, in a bank robbery, the person who points the gun at the teller and asks for the money is guilty of armed robbery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Anyone else directly involved in the commission of the crime, such as the lookout or the getaway car driver, is an accomplice, even if in the absence of an underlying offense keeping a lookout or driving a car would not be an offense
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An accomplice differs from an accessory in that an accomplice is present at the actual crime, and could be prosecuted even if the main criminal (the principal) is not charged or convicted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An accessory is generally not present at the actual crime, and may be subject to lesser penalties than an accomplice or principal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

At law, an accomplice has lesser guilt than the person he or she is assisting, is subject to lesser prosecution for the same crime, and faces the smaller criminal penalties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As such, the three accomplices to the bank robbery above can also to a degree be found guilty of armed robbery even if only one stole money
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The fairness of the doctrine that the accomplice is still guilty has been subject to much discussion, particularly in cases of capital crimes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accomplices have been prosecuted for felony murder even if the actual person who committed the murder died at the crime scene or otherwise did not face capital punishment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In jurisdictions based on the common law, the concept of an accomplice has often been heavily modified by statute, or replaced by new concepts entirely

Annabelle premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on September 29, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 3, 2014
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The film received generally negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing over $256 million against its $6

The 2003 Mission Accomplished speech gets its name from a banner that read "Mission Accomplished" displayed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln during a televised address by United States President George W
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Bush on May 1, 2003 and the controversy that followed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Although Bush stated at the time "Our mission continues" and "We have difficult work to do in Iraq," he also stated that it was the end to major combat operations in Iraq
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Bush never uttered the phrase "Mission Accomplished"; a banner stating "Mission Accomplished" was used as a backdrop to the speech
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Bush's assertion—and the sign itself—became controversial after guerrilla warfare in Iraq increased during the Iraqi insurgency
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The vast majority of casualties, both military and civilian, occurred after the speech

Accordance is a Bible study program for Apple Macintosh and iPhone, and now Windows developed by OakTree Software, Inc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Reviewers consider it a premium program
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Although originally written exclusively for the Mac OS (and then iOS), Accordance has now been released (October 1, 2013) in a Windows-native version, although it was available prior to this by using the Basilisk II emulator
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The program is used for both private and academic study
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The translators of the Holman Christian Standard Bible, completed in 2004, used it for word studies, comparisons and instant searches
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Commenting on the use of Accordance, the HCSB's editor Ed Blum said, "This project used far more computerization than anyone else has ever been able to do
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accordions (from 19th century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys, causing pallets to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called reeds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These vibrate to produce sound inside the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual, and the accompaniment, consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The accordion is widely spread across the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some countries (for example Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) it is used in popular music (for example Forró, Sertanejo and B-Pop in Brazil), whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and as well as in regional and is often used in folk music in Europe, North America and South America
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nevertheless, in Europe and North America, some popular music acts also make use of the instrument
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Additionally, the accordion is also used in cajun, zydeco, jazz music and in both solo and orchestra performances of classical music
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The piano accordion is the official city instrument of San Francisco, California
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika, from the Greek harmonikos, meaning harmonic, musical
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Today, native versions of the name accordion are more common
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These names refer to the type of accordion patented by Cyrill Demian, which concerned "automatically coupled chords on the bass side"

A sanitary napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn by a woman while she is menstruating, while she is recovering from vaginal surgery, for lochia (post-birth bleeding), after an abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These pads are not to be confused with generally higher absorbency incontinence pads, which are worn by men or women who have urinary incontinence problems or experience stress incontinence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Menstrual pads may be used by some people for this purpose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Obstetrics and gynecology (commonly known as OB-GYN, OBG, O&G or obs and gynae) is the medical specialty that deals with obstetrics and gynecology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Postgraduate training programs for both aspects are usually combined, preparing the practicing obstetrician-gynecologist to be adept at the care of female reproductive organs' health and at the management of pregnancy, although many doctors go on to develop subspecialty interests in one field or the other

In ethics and governance, accountability is answerability, blameworthiness, liability, and the expectation of account-giving
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As an aspect of governance, it has been central to discussions related to problems in the public sector, nonprofit and private (corporate) and individual contexts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In leadership roles, accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in other words, an absence of accounting means an absence of accountability
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accountability is an element of a RACI to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails

Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accounting, which has been called the "language of business", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accounting can be divided into several fields including financial accounting, management accounting, external auditing, tax accounting and cost accounting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accounting information systems are designed to support accounting functions and related activities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information, including the preparation of financial statements, to external users of the information, such as investors, regulators and suppliers; and management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information for internal use by management
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The recording of financial transactions, so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as bookkeeping, of which double-entry bookkeeping is the most common system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accounting is facilitated by accounting organizations such as standard-setters, accounting firms and professional bodies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Financial statements are usually audited by accounting firms, and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 GAAP is set by various standard-setting organizations such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States and the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2012, "all major economies" have plans to converge towards or adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An accountant is a practitioner of accounting or accountancy, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and others make decisions about allocating resource(s)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In many jurisdictions, professional accounting bodies maintain standards of practice and evaluations for professionals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accountants who have demonstrated competency through their professional associations' certification exams are certified to use titles such as Chartered Accountant, Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Public Accountant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization's financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Non-qualified accountants may be employed by a qualified accountant, or may work independently without statutory privileges and obligations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Big Four auditors are the largest employers of accountants worldwide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, most accountants are employed in commerce, industry and the public sector

Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages between people using electronics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Email first entered substantial use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Email operates across computer networks, which today is primarily the Internet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Originally an ASCII text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 International email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, has been standardized, but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET, with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Email had an important role in creating the Internet, and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services

Alban Ceray (January 30, 1945) is a Monegasque pornographic actor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland, publicized as a Cold War confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Fischer showed skill at an early age
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At age 13, he won a "brilliancy" that became known as "The Game of the Century"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Starting at age 14, Fischer played in eight United States Championships, winning each by at least a one-point margin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At age 15, Fischer became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

At age 20, Fischer won the 1963–64 U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Championship with 11/11, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His book My 60 Memorable Games (published 1969) is regarded as a classic work of chess literature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Fischer won the 1970 Interzonal Tournament by a record 3½-point margin and won 20 consecutive games, including two unprecedented 6–0 sweeps in the Candidates Matches
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In July 1971, he became the first official FIDE number-one-rated player
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

After losing his title as World Chess Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess and the public eye
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His participation led to a conflict with the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After that, he lived his life as an émigré
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 government
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live in Iceland until his death in 2008
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Fischer made numerous lasting contributions to chess
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess timing system, which added a time increment after each move, now a standard practice in top tournament and match play
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He also invented a new variant of chess named Fischerandom (known today as "Chess960")

Accoutrements are the personal/individual equipment of service people such as soldiers, sailors, police and firemen and employees of some private organizations such as security guards, other than their basic uniform and weapons
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accoutrements can be intended for field, garrison or ceremonial purposes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most accoutrements for field use are purely practical in nature
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Ceremonial accoutrements may no longer have a practical purpose in modern operations but may be retained to maintain a tradition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Garrison accoutrements will vary in their usefulness and include both practical and ceremonial/traditional items
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some accoutrements such as lanyards, have both a traditional/ceremonial and a practical purpose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In these cases a different item may be worn in garrison or ceremonial occasions than that used in the field
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, in the Australian army different corps and units wear different coloured lanyards for service or ceremonial dress, but universally use drab natural fibre coloured lanyards for pistol retention in the field

An actor (often actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who answers"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When used for the stage, women occasionally played the roles of prepubescent boys

 Originally built around three different settlements, including a port (Jamestown), it served as the capital of the British Gold Coast between 1877 and 1957
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Once merely a 19th-century suburb of Victoriaborg, Accra has since transitioned into a modern metropolis; the city's architecture reflects this history, ranging from 19th-century architecture buildings to modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accra serves as the Greater Accra Region's economic and administrative hub
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is furthermore a centre of a wide range of nightclubs, restaurants and hotels
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since the early 1990s, a number of new buildings have been built, including the multi-storey French-owned Novotel hotel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The city's National Theatre was built with Chinese assistance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2010, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network think tank designated Accra a Gamma-minus-level world city, indicating a growing level of international influence and connectedness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Greater Accra region is the most urbanized region in the country with 87
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4% of its total population living in urban centres
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The central business district of Accra contains the city's main banks and department stores, as well as an area known as the Ministries, where Ghana's government administration is concentrated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Economic activities in Accra include the financial and commercial sectors, fishing and the manufacture of processed food, lumber, plywood, textiles, clothing and chemicals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Tourism is becoming a thriving source of business for those in arts and crafts, historical sites and local travel and tour agents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Oxford Street in the district of Osu has grown to become the hub of business and night life in Accra

Accreditation is the process in which certification of competency, authority, or credibility is presented
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Organizations that issue credentials or certify third parties against official standards are themselves formally accredited by accreditation bodies (such as UKAS); hence they are sometimes known as "accredited certification bodies"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The accreditation process ensures that their certification practices are acceptable, typically meaning that they are competent to test and certify third parties, behave ethically and employ suitable quality assurance

An accretionary wedge or accretionary prism forms from sediments accreted onto the non-subducting tectonic plate at a convergent plate boundary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most of the material in the accretionary wedge consists of marine sediments scraped off from the downgoing slab of oceanic crust, but in some cases the wedge includes the erosional products of volcanic island arcs formed on the overriding plate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Accretive Health is one of the United States' largest hospital revenue cycle management companies and sells this and other finance-related services to the healthcare industry
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The company is located in Chicago, Illinois
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The company provides end-to-end revenue cycle management solutions through proprietary operational processes, host-agnostic technology solutions and centralized shared service operations – capabilities include patient registration, insurance and benefit verification, clinical documentation and coding, billing and follow-up services

In English history, praemunire or praemunire facias was a 14th-century law which prohibited the assertion or maintenance of papal jurisdiction, imperial or foreign, or some other alien jurisdiction or claim of supremacy in England, against the supremacy of the monarch
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This law was enforced by the writ of praemunire facias, a writ of summons from which the law takes its name
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name praemunire may denote the statute, the writ, or the offence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Praemunire in classical Latin means to fortify
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In medieval Latin, praemunire was confused with and used for praemonere, to forewarn, as the writ commanded that the sheriff do (facias) warn (praemunire) the summoned person to appear before the Court

Accrual (accumulation) of something is, in finance, the adding together of interest or different investments over a period of time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It holds specific meanings in accounting, where it can refer to accounts on a balance sheet that represent liabilities and non-cash-based assets used in accrual-based accounting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These types of accounts include, among others, accounts payable, accounts receivable, goodwill, deferred tax liability and future interest expense

Acculturation is the process of social, psychological, and cultural change that stems from blending between cultures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The effects of acculturation can be seen at multiple levels in both the original (native) and newly adopted (host) cultures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Historically speaking, acculturation is a direct change of one's culture through dominance over another's culture through either military or political conquest
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At this group level, acculturation often results in changes to culture, customs, religious practices, diet, healthcare, and other social institutions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of the most noticeable group level effects of acculturation often include changes in food, clothing, and language
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At the individual level, the process of acculturation refers to the socialization process by which foreign-born individuals adopt the values, customs, norms, attitudes, and behaviors of the dominant host culture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This process has been linked to changes in daily behavior, as well as numerous changes in psychological and physical well-being
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As enculturation is used to describe the process of first-culture learning, acculturation can be thought of as second-culture learning
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since approximately one in four children in the United States live with at least one immigrant parent, this topic is worthy of understanding and discussing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Scholars in different disciplines have developed more than 100 different theories of acculturation, but the concept of acculturation has only been studied scientifically since 1918
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As it has been approached at different times from the fields of psychology, anthropology, and sociology, numerous theories and definitions have emerged to describe elements of the acculturative process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Despite definitions and evidence that acculturation entails a two-way process of change, research and theory have primarily focused on the adjustments and adaptations made by minorities such as immigrants, refugees, and indigenous peoples in response to their contact with the dominant majority
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Contemporary research has primarily focused on different strategies of acculturation, how variations in acculturation affect individuals, and interventions to make this process easier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The nucleus accumbens (NAc or NAcc), also known as the accumbens nucleus or as the nucleus accumbens septi (Latin for nucleus adjacent to the septum) is a region in the basal forebrain rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle collectively form the ventral striatum, which is part of the striatum the main component of the basal ganglia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each cerebral hemisphere has its own nucleus accumbens, which can be divided into two structures: the nucleus accumbens core and the nucleus accumbens shell
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These substructures have different morphology and functions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Different NAcc subregions (core vs shell) and neuron subpopulations within each region (D1-type vs D2-type medium spiny neurons) are responsible for different cognitive functions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a whole, the nucleus accumbens has a significant role in the cognitive processing of aversion, motivation, reward (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, incentive salience, pleasure, and positive reinforcement), and reinforcement learning; hence, it has a significant role in addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It plays a lesser role in processing fear (a form of aversion), impulsivity, and the placebo effect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is involved in the encoding of new motor programs as well
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Accuracy has two definitions:
More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; as these cause a difference between a result and a "true" value, ISO calls this trueness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Alternatively, ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In simplest terms, given a set of data points from a series of measurements, the set can be said to be precise if the values are close to the average value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be accurate if the values are close to the true value of the quantity being measured
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither

Ronan the Accuser () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He is a judicial officer of the fictional alien race known as the Kree
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though usually portrayed as a supervillain, he is sometimes depicted as a more noble and honorable character
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Ronan has appeared in various forms of media, including several animated television series and video games
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most notably, actor Lee Pace played the character in the 2014 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The accusative case (abbreviated acc) of a noun is the grammatical case used to mark the direct object of a transitive verb
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) prepositions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually used together (such as in Latin) with the nominative case
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, "they" in English is nominative; "them" is accusative
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The sentence "They like them" shows the nominative case and accusative case working in conjunction using the same base word
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The syntactic functions of the accusative consist of designating the immediate object of an action, the intended result, the goal of a motion, and the extent of an action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The accusative case existed in Proto-Indo-European and is present in some Indo-European languages (including Latin, Sanskrit, Greek, German, Icelandic, Bulgarian, Polish, Czech, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian), in the Uralic languages, in Altaic languages and in Semitic languages (such as Hebrew and Classical Arabic)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the partitive case
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In morphosyntactic alignment terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is telic, while the partitive is not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Modern English, which almost entirely lacks declension in its nouns, does not have an explicitly marked accusative case even in the pronouns
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such forms as whom, them, and her derive rather from the old Germanic dative forms, of which the -m and -r endings are characteristic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This conflation of the old accusative, dative, and (after prepositions) genitive cases is the oblique case
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most modern English grammarians no longer use the Latin accusative/dative model, though they tend to use the terms objective for oblique, subjective for nominative, and possessive for genitive (see declension in English)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Hine, a true accusative masculine third person singular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the 19th century

Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is a 1992 psychological horror film directed by David Lynch and written by Lynch and Robert Engels
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a prequel to the television series Twin Peaks (1990–91), created by Mark Frost and Lynch, who were also executive producers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The film revolves around the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley) and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a popular high school student in the fictional Washington town of Twin Peaks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Laura's best friend Donna Hayward (she was replaced by Moira Kelly); and Sherilyn Fenn, owing to scheduling conflicts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Kyle MacLachlan, who starred as Special Agent Dale Cooper in the TV series, was reluctant to return out of fear of getting typecast, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Although it has long been reported that Fire Walk with Me was greeted at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival with booing and jeers from the audience, co-writer Robert Engels denies that this event ever happened
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The film initially received negative reviews in the United States but has been met with a more positive reception in subsequent years, with some viewing it as one of Lynch's major works
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The film fared poorly in the United States at the box office, although it was a commercial hit in Japan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face" is a song from the 1956 musical My Fair Lady, with music by Frederick Loewe and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was originally performed by Rex Harrison as Professor Henry Higgins
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He also performed in the 1964 film version
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The song expresses Professor Henry Higgins's rage at the fact that his pupil Eliza Doolittle has chosen to walk out of his life, and his growing realization of how much he will miss her
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An ace is a playing card
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the standard French deck, an ace has a single suit symbol (a heart, diamond, spade, or club) located in the middle of the card, sometimes large and decorated, especially in the case of the ace of spades
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This embellishment on the ace of spades started when King James VI of Scotland and I of England required an insignia of the printing house to be printed on the ace of spades
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This insignia was necessary for identifying the printing house and stamping it as having paid the new stamp tax
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although this requirement was abolished in 1960, the tradition has been kept by many card makers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other countries the stamp and embellishments are usually found on ace cards; clubs in France, diamonds in Russia, and hearts in Genoa because they have the most blank space
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The word "ace" comes from the Old French word as (from Latin 'as') meaning 'a unit', from the name of a small Roman coin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It originally meant the side of a die with only one pip, before it was a term for a playing card
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since this was the lowest roll of the die, it traditionally meant 'bad luck' in Middle English, but as the ace is often the highest playing card, its meaning has since changed to mean 'high-quality, excellence'

Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When undiluted, it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, the United States, Australia and New Zealand
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The global demand for acetic acid is about 6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 million metric tons per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from methanol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion sequence—also called TRAP sequence, TRAPS, or acardiac twinning—is a rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a severe variant of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The twins' blood systems are connected instead of independent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One twin, called the acardiac twin or TRAP fetus, is severely malformed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The heart is missing or deformed, hence the name acardiac, as are the upper structures of the body 
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The legs may be partially present or missing, and internal structures of the torso are often poorly formed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The other twin is usually normal in appearance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The normal twin, called the pump twin, drives blood through both fetuses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is called reversed arterial perfusion because in the acardiac twin the blood flows in a reversed direction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

TRAP sequence occurs in 1% of monochorionic twin pregnancies and in 1 in 35,000 pregnancies overall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An acequia (Spanish: [aˈθekja]) or séquia (Valencian: [ˈsɛkia]) is a community-operated watercourse used in Spain and former Spanish colonies in the Americas for irrigation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Particularly in Spain, the Andes, northern Mexico, and the modern-day American Southwest, acequias are usually historically engineered canals that carry snow runoff or river water to distant fields
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can also refer to the long central pool in a Moorish garden, such as the Generalife in the Alhambra in Southern Iberia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Aceraceae were recognized as a family of flowering plants also called the maple family
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They contain two to four genera, depending upon the circumscription, of some 120 species of trees and shrubs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A common characteristic is that the leaves are opposite, and the fruit a schizocarp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The maples have long been known to be closely related to the family Sapindaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several taxonomists (including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) now include both the Aceraceae and the Hippocastanaceae in the Sapindaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Recent research (Harrington et al
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 2005) has shown that while both Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae are monophyletic in themselves, their removal from Sapindaceae sensu lato would leave Sapindaceae sensu stricto as a paraphyletic group, particularly with reference to the genus Xanthoceras

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acetate  is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Acetate" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula C2H3O2−
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a positive ion (called a cation) are also commonly called "acetates" (hence, acetate of lead, acetate of aluminum, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CH3CO2−, or CH3COO−
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most of the approximately 5 billion kilograms of acetic acid produced annually in industry is used in the production of acetates, which usually take the form of polymers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In nature, acetate is the most common building block for biosynthesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the fatty acids are produced by connecting the two carbon atoms from acetate to a growing fatty acid

Malpighia emarginata is a tropical fruit-bearing shrub or small tree in the family Malpighiaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Common names include acerola (Spanish pronunciation: [aseˈɾola], Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation [aseˈɾɔlɐ], European Portuguese pronunciation [ɐseˈɾɔlɐ]), Barbados cherry, West Indian cherry, wild crepe myrtle and Seriz (Haitian Creole)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acerola is native to South America, southern Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil, and Central America, but is now also being grown as far north as Texas and in subtropical areas of Asia, such as India

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acetate  is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Acetate" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula C2H3O2−
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a positive ion (called a cation) are also commonly called "acetates" (hence, acetate of lead, acetate of aluminum, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CH3CO2−, or CH3COO−
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most of the approximately 5 billion kilograms of acetic acid produced annually in industry is used in the production of acetates, which usually take the form of polymers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In nature, acetate is the most common building block for biosynthesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the fatty acids are produced by connecting the two carbon atoms from acetate to a growing fatty acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An acervulus (pl
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 acervuli) is a small asexual fruiting body that erupts through the epidermis of host plants parasitised by mitosporic fungi of the form order Melanconiales (Deuteromycota, Coelomycetes)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has the form of a small cushion at the bottom of which short crowded conidiophores are formed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The spores escape through an opening at the top
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acervus is a genus of fungi in the family Pyronemataceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have cup-shaped fruitbodies that may be up to 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 cm (0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
6 in) in diameter, with a bright yellow to orange-colored hymenium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Fruitbodies occur on soil, duff, and plant debris
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Six of the seven species in the genus are found in China
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acetal is a functional group with the following connectivity R2C(OR')2, where both R' groups are organic fragments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore saturated and has tetrahedral geometry
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two R'O groups may be equivalent to each other or not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two R groups can be equivalent to each other (a "symmetric acetal") or not (a "mixed acetal"), and one or both can even be hydrogen atoms rather than organic fragments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetals are formed from and convertible to carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones R2C=O)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term ketal is sometimes used to identify structures associated with ketones rather than aldehydes and, historically, the term acetal was used specifically for the aldehyde cases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Formation of an acetal occurs when the hydroxyl group of a hemiacetal becomes protonated and is lost as water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The carbocation that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of alcohol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Acetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible equilibrium as with esters
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a Dean-Stark apparatus, lest it will hydrolyse the product back to the hemiacetal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present and therefore is not favourable with regards to entropy, unless one uses a diol rather than two discrete alcohol molecules
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A way to improve this is to use an orthoester as a source of alcohol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aldehydes and ketones undergo a process called acetal exchange with orthoesters to give acetals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Water produced along with the acetal product is used up in hydrolysing the orthoester and producing more alcohol to be used in the reaction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acetals are used as protecting groups for carbonyl groups in organic synthesis because they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by bases and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They can either protect the carbonyl in a molecule (by temporarily reacting it with an alcohol) or a diol (by temporarily reacting it with a carbonyl)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 That is, either the carbonyl, or the alcohols, or both could be part of the molecule whose reactivity is to be controlled
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Various specific carbonyl compounds have special names for their acetal forms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, an acetal formed from formaldehyde is sometimes called a "formal" or the methylenedioxy group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acetal formed from acetone is sometimes called an acetonide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is an organic chemical compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also produced by the partial oxidation of alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has listed acetaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetaldehyde is "one of the most frequently found air toxins with cancer risk greater than one in a million"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acetamide (systematic name: ethanamide) is an organic compound with the formula CH3CONH2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the simplest amide derived from acetic acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It finds some use as a plasticizer and as an industrial solvent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The related compound N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) is more widely used, but it is not prepared from acetamide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen or APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is typically used for mild to moderate pain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The quality of the evidence regarding the use for fever relief in children is poor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is often sold in combination with other ingredients such as in many cold medications
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In combination with opioid pain medication, paracetamol is also used for more severe pain such as cancer pain and after surgery
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is typically used either by mouth or rectally but is also available intravenously
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Effects last between two and four hours
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Serious skin rashes may rarely occur, and too high a dose can result in liver failure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It appears to be safe during pregnancy and when breastfeeding
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In those with liver disease, it may still be used, but in lower doses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It does not have significant anti-inflammatory activity and how it works is not entirely clear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Paracetamol was discovered in 1877
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Paracetamol is available as a generic medication with trade names including Tylenol and Panadol among others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The wholesale price in the developing world is less than 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
01 USD per dose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the United States it costs about 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
04 USD per dose

Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When undiluted, it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, the United States, Australia and New Zealand
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The global demand for acetic acid is about 6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 million metric tons per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from methanol

Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important solvent in its own right, typically for cleaning purposes in the laboratory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 About 6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 million tonnes were produced worldwide in 2010, mainly for use as a solvent and production of methyl methacrylate and bisphenol A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a common building block in organic chemistry
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Familiar household uses of acetone are as the active ingredient in nail polish remover, and as paint thinner
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is normally present in blood and urine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 People with diabetes produce it in larger amounts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Reproductive toxicity tests show that it has low potential to cause reproductive problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Pregnant women, nursing mothers and children have higher levels of acetone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Ketogenic diets that increase acetone in the body are used to counter epileptic attacks in infants and children who suffer from recalcitrant refractory epilepsy

In organic chemistry, acetyl is a moiety, the acyl with chemical formula CH3CO
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is sometimes represented by the symbol Ac (not to be confused with the element actinium)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acetyl group contains a methyl group single-bonded to a carbonyl
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The carbonyl center of an acyl radical has one nonbonded electron with which it forms a chemical bond to the remainder R of the molecule
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In IUPAC nomenclature, acetyl is called ethanoyl, although this term is rarely heard
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acetyl moiety is a component of many organic compounds, including acetic acid, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acetyl-CoA, acetylcysteine, and the analgesics acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) and acetylsalicylic acid (better known as aspirin)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acetylcholine (ACh) is an organic chemical that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals, including humans, as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Substances that interfere with acetylcholine activity are called anticholinergics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction—in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acetylcholine is also used as a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, both as an internal transmitter for the sympathetic nervous system and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the brain, acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They play an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Partly because of its muscle-activating function, but also because of its functions in the autonomic nervous system and brain, a large number of important drugs exert their effects by altering cholinergic transmission
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria, as well as chemical nerve agents such as Sarin, cause harm by inactivating or hyperactivating muscles via their influences on the neuromuscular junction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Drugs that act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, such as atropine, can be poisonous in large quantities, but in smaller doses they are commonly used to treat certain heart conditions and eye problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Scopolamine, which acts mainly on muscarinic receptors in the brain, can cause delirium and amnesia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The addictive qualities of nicotine derive from its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acetylene (systematic name: ethyne) is the chemical compound with the formula C2H2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As an alkyne, acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in a triple bond
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In organic chemistry, the term acetylenic designates
A doubly unsaturated position (sp-hybridized) on a molecular framework, for instance in an alkyne such as acetylene;

Achates, a Sicilian who came to Aristaeus in order to join Dionysus in his Indian campaign
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An achene (Greek ἀ, a, privative + χαίνειν, chainein, to gape; also sometimes called akene and occasionally achenium or achenocarp) is a type of simple dry fruit produced by many species of flowering plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Achenes are monocarpellate (formed from one carpel) and indehiscent (they do not open at maturity)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Achenes contain a single seed that nearly fills the pericarp, but does not adhere to it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many species, what is called the "seed" is an achene, a fruit containing the seed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The seed-like appearance is owed to the hardening of the wall of the seed-vessel, which encloses the solitary seed so closely as to seem like an outer coat

The Acheron (; Ancient Greek: Ἀχέρων (Acheron) or Ἀχερούσιος (Acherusius); Modern Greek: Αχέροντας (Acherontas)) is a river located in the Epirus region of northwest Greece
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its source is near the village Zotiko, in the southwestern part of the Ioannina regional unit it flows into the Ionian Sea in Ammoudia, near Parga
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acherontia atropos (Greater death's head hawkmoth) is the most widely known of the three species of death's-head hawkmoth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acherontia species are notorious for a vaguely skull-shaped pattern on the thorax

Acheta is a genus of field crickets
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It most notably contains the house cricket Acheta domestica
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to the Code of Zoological Nomenclature, this generic name is feminine in gender
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For this reason, the specific names (epithets) must agree in gender with the generic name, and therefore be written in the feminine gender

SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The letters S and M usually mean specific and measurable
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Possibly the most common version has the remaining letters referring to achievable, relevant and time-bound
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, the term's inventor had a slightly different version and the letters have meant different things to different authors, as described below
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Additional letters have been added by some authors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first-known use of the term occurs in the November 1981 issue of Management Review by George T
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Doran
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The principal advantage of SMART objectives is that they are easier to understand and to know when they have been done
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 SMART criteria are commonly associated with Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept

The Enneagram of Personality, or simply the Enneagram (from the Greek words ἐννέα [ennéa, meaning "nine"] and γράμμα [grámma, meaning something "written" or "drawn"]), is a model of the human psyche which is principally understood and taught as a typology of nine interconnected personality types
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although the origins and history of many of the ideas and theories associated with the Enneagram of Personality are a matter of dispute, contemporary Enneagram understandings are principally derived from the teachings of Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Naranjo's theories were partly influenced by some earlier teachings of G
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 I
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Gurdjieff
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a typology the Enneagram defines nine personality types (sometimes referred to as "enneatypes"), which are represented by the points of a geometric figure called an enneagram, which, it is believed, also indicate some of the connections between the types
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are different schools of thought among Enneagram teachers, therefore their ideas on some theoretical aspects are not always in agreement
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Enneagram of Personality has been widely promoted in both business management and spiritual contexts through seminars, conferences, books, magazines, and DVDs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In business contexts it is generally used as a typology to gain insights into workplace dynamics; in spirituality it is more commonly presented as a path to higher states of being, essence, and enlightenment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been described as a method for self-understanding and self-development

Achillea  is a group of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to legend, Achilles' soldiers used yarrow to treat their wounds, hence some of its common names such as allheal and bloodwort
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus is native primarily to Europe, temperate areas of Asia, and North America
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The common name "yarrow" is usually applied to Achillea millefolium, but may also be used for other species within the genus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These plants typically have frilly, hairy, aromatic leaves
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The plants show large, flat clusters of small flowers at the top of the stem
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The flowers can be white, yellow, orange, pink or red and are generally visited by many insects, and are thus characterised by a generalised pollination system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Achillea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species - see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Achillea

In Greek mythology, Achilles (, uh-KILL-eez; Greek: Ἀχιλλεύς [a
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
kʰil
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
le͜ús]) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer's Iliad
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His mother was the immortal nymph Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Alluding to these legends, the term "Achilles heel" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Achimenes  is a genus of about 25 species of tropical and subtropical rhizomatous perennial herbs in the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have a multitude of common names such as magic flowers, widow's tears, Cupid's bower, or hot water plant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: ὑπόκρισις, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The perianth (perigonium, perigon or perigone) is the non-reproductive part of the flower, and structure that forms an envelope surrounding the sexual organs, consisting of the calyx (sepals) and the corolla (petals)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term perianth is derived from the Greek περί, peri, meaning around, and άνθος, anthos, meaning flower, while perigonium is derived from gonos, meaning seed, i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 sexual organs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the mosses and liverworts (Marchantiophyta), the perianth is the sterile tubelike tissue that surrounds the female reproductive structure (or developing sporophyte)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Achlorhydria  or hypochlorhydria refers to states where the production of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions of the stomach and other digestive organs is absent or low, respectively
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is associated with various other medical problems

Achoerodus is a genus of wrasses collectively known as blue gropers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are found in the coastal waters of southern Australia and distinguished by the bright blue colouring of the adult males
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The thick-bodied blue gropers have peg teeth, heavy scales, large tails and thick lips
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Juveniles are brown to green brown
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adult females are brown to greenish-yellow
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each scale may have a darker red spot
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The adult males have the bright blue colouring that give the fish their name
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The blue can range from deep navy to cobalt blue, and there may also be darker or yellow-orange spots or lines around the eyes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

All blue gropers begin life as females
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As they mature, they go through an initial phase, in which they may be male or female, before developing their adult colouring and reaching the terminal phase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Typically you will only find one or two male blue gropers in an area, with a larger number of the female gropers in the same area
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Should the dominant male blue groper die, the largest female will grow, change colour and sex, and become the dominant male
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In Australia certain States like New South Wales have granted protection to this species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It's considered the state fish symbol for the territory and illegal to spear blue groper
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There is also a limitation on fishing for them with a line
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are extremely inquisitive, and while it is now discouraged to feed them by cutting up urchins, they still will approach divers as if expecting to be fed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their lifespan is said to be up to 35 years according to some sources, more according to others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The fish live in a variety of coastal waters, especially exposed reefs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1998, the eastern blue groper was made the state fish emblem of New South Wales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The acholia is the lack or absence of bile secretion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acholia is an uncommon trouble of the biliary function in the liver; bile flow dissipates
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In anthropology, Achomawi (also Achumawi, Ajumawi and Ahjumawi) are the northerly nine (out of eleven) bands of the Pit River tribe of Native Americans who lived in what is now northeastern California in the United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These nine autonomous bands (also called "tribelets") of the Pit River Indians spoke various dialects of one common language, and the other two bands spoke dialects of a related language, called Atsugewi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name "Achomawi" means river dwelling (from ajumma, "river") and the band historically inhabited the Fall River Valley and the Pit River from the south end of Big Valley Mountains, westerly to Pit River Falls
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The other eight bands that shared the Achomawi language had a historic homeland located along other parts of the Pit River
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their territory extended from Big Bend to Goose Lake
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This land was also home to the Atsugewi language group, which consisted of two distinct bands of what is now unified as the Pit River Tribe, and who lived south of the Achomawi language bands in the Hat Creek valley and Dixie Valley
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An achondrite is a stony meteorite that does not contain chondrules
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It consists of material similar to terrestrial basalts or plutonic rocks and has been differentiated and reprocessed to a lesser or greater degree due to melting and recrystallization on or within meteorite parent bodies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a result, achondrites have distinct textures and mineralogies indicative of igneous processes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Achondrites account for about 8% of meteorites overall, and the majority (about two thirds) of them are HED meteorites, possibly originating from the crust of asteroid 4 Vesta
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other types include Martian, Lunar, and several types thought to originate from as-yet unidentified asteroids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These groups have been determined on the basis of e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 the Fe/Mn chemical ratio and the 17O/18O oxygen isotope ratios, thought to be characteristic "fingerprints" for each parent body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Diogenites are a group of the HED meteorite clan, a type of achondritic stony meteorites
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Achondroplasia is a common cause of dwarfism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It occurs as a sporadic mutation in about 80% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) or it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

People with achondroplasia have short stature, with an average adult height of 131 centimeters (52 inches) for males and 123 centimeters (48 inches) for females
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Achondroplastic adults are known to be as short as 62
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8 cm (24
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 in)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If both parents are achondroplasic and pass on the mutant gene, then it is very unlikely that the homozygous child will live past a few months of its life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The prevalence is about 1 in 25,000

Manilkara zapota, commonly known as the sapodilla (), is a long-lived, evergreen tree native to southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucatán in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is grown in large quantities in Pakistan, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Mexico
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name "zapota" from the Spanish zapote [θaˈpote] ultimately derives from the Nahuatl word tzapotl

In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties and, thus, can be perceived as single logical operation on the data, is called a transaction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder coined the acronym ACID as shorthand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, building on earlier work by Jim Gray who enumerated Atomicity, Consistency, and Durability but left out Isolation when characterizing the transaction concept
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These four properties describe the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

According to Gray and Reuter, IMS supported ACID transactions as early as 1973 (although the term ACID came later)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acid-fastness is a physical property of certain bacterial and eukaryotic cells, as well as some sub-cellular structures, specifically their resistance to decolorization by acids during laboratory staining procedures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Once stained as part of a sample, these organisms can resist the acid and/or ethanol-based decolorization procedures common in many staining protocols, hence the name acid-fast
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The mechanisms of acid-fastness vary by species, although the most well-known example is in the genus Mycobacterium, which includes the species responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acid-fastness of Mycobacteria is due to the high mycolic acid content of their cell walls, which is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some bacteria may also be partially acid-fast
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acid-fast organisms are difficult to characterize using standard microbiological techniques, though they can be stained using concentrated dyes, particularly when the staining process is combined with heat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some, such as Mycobacteria, can be stained with the Gram stain, but they do not take the crystal violet well and thus appear light purple, which can still potentially result in an incorrect gram positive identification
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, in which the acid-fast species are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Another method is the Kinyoun method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acid-fast Mycobacteria can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The eggs of the parasitic lung fluke Paragonimus westermani are actually destroyed by the stain, which can hinder diagnosis in patients who present with TB-like symptoms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Formic acid, systemically named methanoic acid, is the simplest carboxylic acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The chemical formula is HCOOH or HCO2H
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in some ants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word "formic" comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies, and the trivial name in some languages means "ant-acid", such as Dutch mierenzuur, Danish myresyre, Faroese meyrusýra and German Ameisensäure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Esters, salts, and the anions derived from formic acid are called formates
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Basophilic is a technical term used by histologists
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It describes the microscopic appearance of cells and tissues, as seen down the microscope, after a histological section has been stained with a basic dye
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The most common such dye is haematoxylin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Basophilic describes the appearance of structures seen in histological sections which take up basic dyes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The structures usually stained are those that contain negative charges, such as the phosphate backbone of DNA in the cell nucleus and ribosomes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Basophils" are cells that "love" the blue, and usually show up deep blue under standard staining techniques (H&E)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Specifically, this term refers to:
basophil granulocytes
anterior pituitary basophils
Different definitions will apply to basophilic:
"Basophilic stains" are acidic stains called "base loving" stains
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Basophilic substances" are "base loving" cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Basophilic substances" attract basic dyes, such as haematoxylin; "Eosin" is referred to as an acidophilic stain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Simplistically, acid pH stains (positive charge) are attracted to the base pH tissue (negative charge), so they are called "basophilic stains"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Eosinophils (base components that like acids) are dyed red by the "basophilic stain" or acid stain, eosin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Basophils" (acid that like base components) are dyed blue by the acidophilic or basic stain, hematoxylin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H+), or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the solute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid

Volcanic gases include a variety of substances given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) volcanoes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The sources of volcanic gases on Earth include:
primordial and recycled constituents from the Earth's mantle,
assimilated constituents from the Earth's crust,
groundwater and the Earth's atmosphere
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Substances that may become gaseous or give off gases when heated are termed volatile substances
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acid–base titration is the determination of the concentration of an acid or base by exactly neutralizing the acid or base with an acid or base of known concentration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This allows for quantitative analysis of the concentration of an unknown acid or base solution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It makes use of the neutralization reaction that occurs between acids and bases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 pKa and Ka (acid constants) can also be determined from a pH titration graph
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acid–base titrations can also be used to find percent purity of chemicals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The acids in wine are an important component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine as well as the growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
9 and 3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
9
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking

In the anterior pituitary, the term "acidophil" is used to describe two different types of cells:
somatotrophs, which generate somatotropin (also known as growth hormone; a protein hormone)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

mammotrophs, which generate prolactin (a protein hormone)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

When using standard staining techniques, they cannot be distinguished from each other (though they can be distinguished from basophils and chromophobes), and are therefore identified simply as "acidophils"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acidophiles or acidophilic organisms are those that thrive under highly acidic conditions (usually at pH 2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0 or below)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These organisms can be found in different branches of the tree of life, including Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Delta Ratio is a formula that can be used to assess elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and to evaluate whether a mixed acid base disorder (metabolic acidosis) is present
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The anion gap (AG) is calculated first and if an anion gap is present, results in either a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) or a normal anion gap acidosis (NAGMA)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A low anion gap is usually an oddity of measurement, rather than a clinical concern [see anion gap for an explanation of low anion gap metabolic acidosis]
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The equation for calculating the Delta Ratio is:

   (AG – 12) 
  ___________
  (24 - [HCO3¯])
and reflects either an increase in the anion gap or a decrease in the bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3¯])
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The ratio gives one of four results:

    1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
     < 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4       due to a pure NAGMA

    2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
     0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4 - 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8   due to a mixed NAGMA + HAGMA

    3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
     0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8 - 2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0   due to a pure HAGMA

    4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
     >2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
0        due to a mixed HAGMA + metabolic alkalosis (or pre-existing compensated respiratory acidosis)

Results 2 and 4 are the ones which have mixed acid-base disorders
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Results 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 and 4
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 are oddities, mathematically speaking:

Result 1: if there is a normal anion gap acidosis, the [ AG - 12 ] part of the equation will be close to zero, the delta ratio will be close to zero and there is no mixed acid-base disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Your calculations can stop here
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A  normal anion gap acidosis (NAGMA) has more to do with a change in  [Cl¯]) or [HCO3¯] concentrations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 So the AG doesn’t change; but to maintain electrical equilibrium, if [Cl¯] goes up, [HCO3¯] must come down
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Hence, hyperchloremia always causes a metabolic acidosis as [HCO3¯] must fall; alternatively, if the [HCO3¯] rises, the [Cl¯] must fall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For a list of the common causes of this change in bicarbonate or chloride, see  normal anion gap acidosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Results 2-4 all involve HAGMAs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A high anion gap metabolic acidosis usually occurs because of an increase in anions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 So in the equation:

   AG = [Na⁺] - ([Cl¯] - [HCO3¯] - [A¯])

it is the [A¯] that is the cause
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For a list of the common anions responsible, see high anion gap metabolic acidosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 KULT is probably the easiest of the mnemonics to use [ Ketones, Ureamia, Lactate, Toxins ]
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Toxins are an uncommon cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis - a list of the commonest toxins is ACE GIFTs [ ibid]
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Metformin as a pure toxicological cause is vanishingly rare
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Result 4: if the result of the ratio is greater than 2 in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, it is usually because there was a pre-existing higher than normal bicarbonate level
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is commonly found in people with chronic respiratory acidosis from chronic lung disease such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), who can't breathe off their excess carbon dioxide owing to poor lung function, and retain bicarb in order to counteract the acidosis caused by the retained CO2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Alternatively it could be caused by a concurrent metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting causing acid loss and hence alkalosis, or diuretic use with loss of Cl- and a compensatory bicarb retention in order to maintain plasma electrical neutrality
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Mathematically this is reflected in a high anion gap, but because the bicarbonate was high to start, it will appear to fall only a small amount
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When this happens the numerator is large, the denominator is small, and the result is a delta ratio which is high [ > 2 ]
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This means a combined high anion gap metabolic acidosis and a pre-existing either respiratory acidosis or metabolic alkalosis (causing the high bicarbonate) - i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 a mixed acid - base metabolic acidosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


Result 3: if there is a pure HAGMA, you would expect the bicarb to fall at a similar rate as the anion gap rises, since one molecule of acid combines with one molecule of bicarb buffer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 So the equation above should be balanced as the change in the AG away from normal [12 ] is similar to the change in bicarb away from normal  [24]
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mathematically if the change in the numerator is similar to the change in the denominator, the delta ratio will be close to 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since the anions are unable to diffuse out of the bloodstream, while bicarbonate and hydrogen ions diffuse with ease (as H₂CO₃, carbonic acid), the usual result will be closer to a delta ratio of 1 to 2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lactic acidosis usually causes a ratio of 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
6 

Result 2: if the delta ratio is somewhere between low (<0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
4) and high (1-2), then it is usually due to a combination of high anion gap metabolic acidosis and normal anion gap acidosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, a person with cholera may have a normal anion gap acidosis due to diarrhea, but becomes progressively dehydrated and develops a lactic acidosis from shock, and proceeds to develop a high anion gap metabolic acidosis - i

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acidosis is a process causing increased acidity in the blood and other body tissues (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, an increased hydrogen ion concentration)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If not further qualified, it usually refers to acidity of the blood plasma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term acidemia describes the state of low blood pH, while acidosis is used to describe the processes leading to these states
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nevertheless, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The distinction may be relevant where a patient has factors causing both acidosis and alkalosis, wherein the relative severity of both determines whether the result is a high, low, or normal pH
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acidosis is said to occur when arterial pH falls below 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
35 (except in the fetus – see below), while its counterpart (alkalosis) occurs at a pH over 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
45
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Arterial blood gas analysis and other tests are required to separate the main causes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The rate of cellular metabolic activity affects and, at the same time, is affected by the pH of the body fluids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In mammals, the normal pH of arterial blood lies between 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
35 and 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
50 depending on the species (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
35 and 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
45)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Blood pH values compatible with life in mammals are limited to a pH range between 6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8 and 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Changes in the pH of arterial blood (and therefore the extracellular fluid) outside this range result in irreversible cell damage

Errantia, occasionally Aciculata, is a subclass of polychaete worms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These worms are found worldwide in marine environments and brackish water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acidulated water is water where some sort of acid is added—often lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar—to prevent cut or skinned fruits or vegetables from browning so as to maintain their appearance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some vegetables and fruits which are often placed in acidulated water are: apples, avocados, celeriac, potatoes and pears
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When the fruit or vegetable is removed from the mixture, it will usually resist browning for at least an hour or two, even though it is being exposed to oxygen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An added benefit of placing items in acidulated water is that the food item acquires a taste of the acid used, which can be very pleasant on the palate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acidulated water, most often made with the use of vinegar, can be used on an aged, hanging beef carcass (butchered) to help clean it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The hanging primals / sub-primals can be wiped down with a cloth that has been submerged in the acidulated solution to help remove the "slick" surface that can build up during the aging process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acidulated water can also be used for hydrogen and oxygen synthesis via electrolysis

                                   2H2O -(electrolysis)→  2H2 + O2

The Hranice Abyss (Czech: Hranická propast), the English name adopted by the local tourist authorities, is the deepest pit cave in the Czech Republic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a karst sinkhole located near the town of Hranice (Přerov District)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The greatest confirmed depth (as of 27 September 2016) is 473 m (404 m under the water level), which makes it the deepest known underwater cave in the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Moreover, the expected depth is 800–1200 m
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Hranice Abyss was created by a collapse of the cave roof, which was eaten away by warm carbonic acidulous spring water in limestone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acineta, abbreviated as Acn in horticultural trade, is a small genus belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is derived from the Greek word 'akinetos' (immobile), referring to the rigid labellum (lip)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These epiphytic orchids occur in tropical mountainous forests from Mexico to western South America, at altitudes up to 2,000 m
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are sometimes lithophytic when found on steep embankments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The large, plicate leaves are parallel-nerved and resemble those of Peristeria and Lycaste, while the structure of the flowers bears a closer resemblance to Stanhopea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The species produce a pendent inflorescence, bearing racemes of many fragrant cup-shaped, pale yellow to reddish brown flowers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The sidelobes of the labellum (lip) come together in a central callus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The basal part of the lip (hypochile) is at least as long as the sidelobes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The column is pubescent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The column of these orchids bears two pollinia, except in Acineta dalessandroi, which has four (making its classification in this genus doubtful)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These orchids are insect pollinated by male bees in the genus Eulaema or Eufriesia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some regard these as being among of the most splendid looking of all orchids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

For relatives of Acineta see Stanhopeinae

An acinus (; plural, acini; adjective, acinar  or acinous) refers to any cluster of cells that resembles a many-lobed "berry", such as a raspberry (acinus is Latin for "berry")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The berry-shaped termination of an exocrine gland, where the secretion is produced, is acinar in form, as is the alveolar sac containing multiple alveoli in the lungs

Acinonyx is a genus within the cat family
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The only living species of this genus, the cheetah, A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 jubatus, occurs and thrives in open grasslands of Africa and Asia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though often described as a big cat, this term is used primarily to describe cats of the Panthera genus, ruling the cheetah out as a big cat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acinos is a genus of ten species of annual and short-lived evergreen perennial woody plants native to southern Europe and western Asia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its name comes from the Greek word akinos, the name of a small aromatic plant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are small, tufted, bushy or spreading plants growing to 10-45 cm tall
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The 2-lipped, tubular flowers are in whorls borne on erect spike-like inflorescence produced in mid-summer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Selected species
Acinos alpinus
Acinos arvensis
Acinos corsicus
Acinos rotundifolius
Acinos suaveolens
Acinos troodi

Acipenser is a genus of sturgeons
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 With 17 species, many of which are threatened, it is the largest genus in the order Acipenseriformes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family is grouped into four genera: Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Four species may now be extinct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two closely related species, Polyodon spathula (paddlefish) and Psephurus gladius (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be "true" sturgeons
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as "primitive fishes" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 7–12 feet (2-3½ m) in length
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing 1,571 kg (3,463 lb) and 7
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
2 m (24 ft) long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Several species of sturgeon are harvested for their roe which is processed into caviar—a luxury food and the reason why caviar-producing sturgeons are among the most valuable of all wildlife resources
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most species of sturgeon are considered to be at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In art, a sturgeon is the symbol on the coat of arms for Saint Amalberga of Temse

The ackee, also known as achee, ackee apple or ayee (Blighia sapida) is a fruit, which is the member of the Sapindaceae (soapberry family), as are the lychee and the longan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is native to tropical West Africa in Cameroon, Gabon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Yorùbá it is known as íṣin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The scientific name honours Captain William Bligh who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England in 1793 and introduced it to science
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The common name is derived from the West African Akan akye fufo
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The fruit was imported to Jamaica from West Africa before 1778
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since then it has become a major feature of various Caribbean cuisines, and is also cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas elsewhere around the world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In data networking, telecommunications, and computer buses, an acknowledgement (ACK) is a signal passed between communicating processes, computers, or devices to signify acknowledgement, or receipt of response, as part of a communications protocol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The negative-acknowledgement (NAK or NACK) signal is sent to reject a previously received message, or to indicate some kind of error
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acknowledgements and negative acknowledgements inform a sender of the receiver's state so that it can adjust its own state accordingly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Genetics is thought to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The role of diet and cigarette smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Many treatment options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 2015, acne was estimated to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lower rates are reported in some rural societies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties

Acneiform eruptions are a group of dermatoses including acne vulgaris, rosacea, folliculitis, and perioral dermatitis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Restated, acneiform eruptions are follicular eruptions characterized by papules and pustules resembling acne
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The hybrid term acneiform, literally, refers to an appearance similar to acne
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The terminology used in this field can be complex, and occasionally contradictory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some sources consider acne vulgaris part of the differential diagnosis for an acneiform eruption
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other sources classified acne vulgaris under acneiform eruption
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 MeSH explicitly excludes perioral dermatitis from the category of "acneiform eruptions", though it does group acneiform eruptions and perioral dermatitis together under "facial dermatoses"

 Most of the species formerly placed under Pleurothallis subgenus Acianthera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This splitting is a result of recent DNA sequencing

Acacia, commonly known as the wattles or acacias, is a large genus of shrubs and trees in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the pea family Fabaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Initially it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa and Australia, with the first species A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 nilotica described by Linnaeus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Controversy erupted in the early 2000s when it became evident that the genus as it stood was not monophyletic, and that several divergent lineages needed to be placed in separate genera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It turned out that one lineage comprising over 900 species mainly native to Australia was not closely related to the mainly African lineage that contained A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 nilotica—the first and type species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This meant that the Australian lineage (by far the most prolific in number of species) would need to be renamed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Botanist Les Pedley named this group Racosperma, which was inconsistently adopted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Australian botanists proposed that this would be more disruptive than setting a different type species (A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 penninervis) and allowing this large number of species to remain Acacia, resulting in the two African lineages being renamed Vachellia and Senegalia, and the two New World lineages renamed Acaciella and Mariosousa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This was officially adopted, but many botanists from Africa and elsewhere disagreed that this was necessary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A number of species have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The heterogeneous group varies considerably in habit, from mat-like subshrubs to canopy trees in forest

Aconcagua (Spanish pronunciation: [akoŋˈkaɣwa]) is the highest mountain outside Asia, at 6,961 metres (22,838 ft), and by extension the highest point in both the Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the Mendoza Province, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres (70 mi) northwest of its capital, the city of Mendoza
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The summit is also located about five kilometres from San Juan Province and 15 kilometres from the international border with Chile
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The mountain itself lies entirely within Argentina and immediately east of Argentina's border with Chile
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its nearest higher neighbor is Tirich Mir in the Hindu Kush, 16,520 kilometres (10,270 mi) away
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is one of the Seven Summits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aconcagua is bounded by the Valle de las Vacas to the north and east and the Valle de los Horcones Inferior to the west and south
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The mountain and its surroundings are part of the Aconcagua Provincial Park
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The mountain has a number of glaciers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about 10 kilometres long, which descends from the south face to about 3600 metres in altitude near the Confluencia camp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about 5 kilometres long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The most well-known is the north-eastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aconitum (), commonly known as aconite, monkshood, wolf's bane, leopard's bane, mousebane, women's bane, devil's helmet, queen of poisons, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These herbaceous perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most species are extremely poisonous and must be dealt with carefully
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acorus calamus (also called sweet flag or calamus, among many common names) is a tall perennial wetland monocot of the Acoraceae family, in the genus Acorus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acraea (Ancient Greek: Ἀκραία) was a name that had several uses in Greek and Roman mythology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea was a daughter of the river-god Asterion near Mycenae, who together with her sisters Euboea and Prosymna (Πρόσυμνα) acted as nurses to Hera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A hill Acraea opposite the temple of Hera near Mycenae derived its name from her
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea and Acraeus are also epithets given to various goddesses and gods whose temples were situated upon hills, such as Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite, Pallas, Artemis, and others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The acorn, or oak nut, is the nut of the oaks and their close relatives (genera Quercus and Lithocarpus, in the family Fagaceae)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It usually contains a single seed (occasionally two seeds), enclosed in a tough, leathery shell, and borne in a cup-shaped cupule
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acorns are 1–6 cm (0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
39–2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
36 in) long and 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
8–4 cm (0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
31–1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
57 in) broad
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acorns take between 6 and 24 months (depending on the species) to mature; see List of Quercus species for details of oak classification, in which acorn morphology and phenology are important factors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acorus is a genus of monocot flowering plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This genus was once placed within the family Araceae (aroids), but more recent classifications place it in its own family Acoraceae and order Acorales, of which it is the sole genus of the oldest surviving line of monocots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some older studies indicated that it was placed in a lineage (the order Alismatales), that also includes aroids (Araceae), Tofieldiaceae, and several families of aquatic monocots (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, Alismataceae, Posidoniaceae)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, modern phylogenetic studies demonstrate that Acorus is sister to all other monocots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common names include calamus and sweet flag
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The genus is native to North America and northern and eastern Asia, and naturalised in southern Asia and Europe from ancient cultivation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The known wild populations are diploid except for some tetraploids in eastern Asia, while the cultivated plants are sterile triploids, probably of hybrid origin between the diploid and tetraploid forms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acosta is a Spanish and Portuguese surname
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Originally it was used to refer to a person who lived by the seashore or from the mountains (encostas)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It comes from the Portuguese da Costa (cognate of English "coast"), which in Spanish became de Acosta
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acoustically is the fourth studio album by ARIA Award winning, Torres Strait Islander singer Christine Anu
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The album sees Anu perform acoustic versions of her hits as well as show cashing new material, including "Last to go", a song dedicated to a friend lost in Bali, and "Ocean of Regret", a Neil Murray composition originally demoed for her landmark debut Stylin' Up
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
  It was released in 2005 on the Liberation Blue label

Acoustics is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Robert Bruce Lindsay's 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The word "acoustic" is derived from the Greek word ἀκουστικός (akoustikos), meaning "of or for hearing, ready to hear" and that from ἀκουστός (akoustos), "heard, audible", which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω (akouo), "I hear"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Latin synonym is "sonic", after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Frequencies above and below the audible range are called "ultrasonic" and "infrasonic", respectively
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An interpersonal relationship is a strong, deep, or close association or acquaintance between two or more people that may range in duration from brief to enduring
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This association may be based on inference, love, solidarity, regular business interactions, or some other type of social commitment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Interpersonal relationships are formed in the context of social, cultural and other influences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The context can and may and perhaps will vary from family or kinship relations, friendship, marriage, relations with associates, work, clubs, neighborhoods, and places of worship
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They may be regulated by law, custom, or mutual agreement, and are the basis of social groups and society as a whole

Percy Bysshe Shelley (; 4 August 1792 – 8 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic poets, and is regarded by some as among the finest lyric poets in the English language, and one of the most influential
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views, Shelley did not see fame during his lifetime, but recognition for his poetry grew steadily following his death
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Shelley was a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and writers that included Lord Byron, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Love Peacock, and his own second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Shelley is perhaps best known for classic poems such as Ozymandias, Ode to the West Wind, To a Skylark, Music, When Soft Voices Die, The Cloud and The Masque of Anarchy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His other major works include a groundbreaking verse drama The Cenci (1819) and long, visionary poems such as Queen Mab (later reworked as The Daemon of the World), Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Adonaïs, Prometheus Unbound (1820)—widely considered to be his masterpiece—Hellas: A Lyrical Drama (1821), and his final, unfinished work, The Triumph of Life (1822)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Shelley's close circle of friends included some of the most important progressive thinkers of the day, including his father-in-law, the philosopher William Godwin, and Leigh Hunt
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though Shelley's poetry and prose output remained steady throughout his life, most publishers and journals declined to publish his work for fear of being arrested for either blasphemy or sedition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Shelley's poetry sometimes had only an underground readership during his day, but his poetic achievements are widely recognized today, and his political and social thought impacted the Chartist and other movements in England, and reach down to the present day
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Shelley's theories of economics and morality, for example, had a profound influence on Karl Marx; his early—perhaps first—writings on nonviolent resistance influenced both Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Shelley became a lodestone to the subsequent three or four generations of poets, including important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as Robert Browning and Dante Gabriel Rossetti
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was admired by Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Bertrand Russell, W
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 B
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Yeats, Upton Sinclair and Isadora Duncan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience was apparently influenced by Shelley's writings and theories on non-violence in protest and political action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Shelley's popularity and influence has continued to grow in contemporary poetry circles

"Acquiesce" is a song by the English rock band Oasis, written by Noel Gallagher
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The song originally appeared as a B-side to Oasis' first UK #1 single, "Some Might Say", in April 1995
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its popularity led to it being included on the B-sides compilation album The Masterplan, released in 1998, after being voted for inclusion by fans of the band on their official website
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1998, the song was issued as a radio single in the United States to promote the release of The Masterplan
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It reached #24 in the US Modern Rock Chart, based on radio airplay
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Acquiesce" was also released as one of the lead tracks to the Stop the Clocks EP, in promotion of their compilation album of which it also appears on, Stop the Clocks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The verses to "Acquiesce" are sung by Liam Gallagher, with the chorus sung by Noel (because, he claims, Liam could not reach the high notes), making it the first song to ever feature both Gallagher brothers on lead vocals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The only other Oasis songs to feature both brothers on lead vocals are "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is", from their 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, "Born on a Different Cloud", from their 2002 album Heathen Chemistry, and "Let There Be Love", from their 2005 album Don't Believe the Truth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their cover version of The Who's My Generation also features both brothers on lead vocals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In law, acquiescence occurs when a person knowingly stands by without raising any objection to the infringement of their rights, while someone else unknowingly and without malice aforethought makes a claim on their rights
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Consequently, the person whose rights are infringed loses the ability to make a claim against the infringer, or succeed in an injunction suit due to the infringer's conduct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term is most generally a kind of "permission" given by silence or passiveness

An acquiring bank (also known simply as an acquirer) is a bank or financial institution that processes credit or debit card payments on behalf of a merchant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acquirer allows merchants to accept credit card payments from the card-issuing banks within an association
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The best-known (credit) card associations are Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Indian Rupay, American Express, Diners Club, Japan Credit Bureau and China UnionPay
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The acquiring bank enters into a contract with a merchant and offers it a merchant account
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This arrangement provides the merchant with a line of credit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Under the agreement, the acquiring bank exchanges funds with issuing banks on behalf of the merchant, and pays the merchant for its daily payment-card activity's net balance—that is, gross sales minus reversals, interchange fees, and acquirer fees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acquirer fees are an additional markup added to association interchange fees by the acquiring bank, varying at the acquirer's discretion

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As an aspect of strategic management, M&A can allow enterprises to grow, shrink, and change the nature of their business or competitive position
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

From a legal point of view, a merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one entity, whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity's stock, equity interests or assets
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a "merger" and an "acquisition" is less clear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A transaction legally structured as an acquisition may have the effect of placing one party's business under the indirect ownership of the other party's shareholders, while a transaction legally structured as a merger may give each party's shareholders partial ownership and control of the combined enterprise
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A deal may be euphemistically called a "merger of equals" if both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies, while when the deal is unfriendly (that is, when the management of the target company opposes the deal) it may be regarded as an "acquisition"

In the common law tradition, an acquittal formally certifies that the accused is free from the charge of an offense, as far as the criminal law is concerned
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is so even where the prosecution is abandoned nolle prosequi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The finality of an acquittal is dependent on the jurisdiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some countries, such as the United States, under the rules of double jeopardy and autrefois acquit, an acquittal operates to bar the retrial of the accused for the same offense, even if new evidence surfaces that further implicates the accused
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The effect of an acquittal on criminal proceedings is the same whether it results from a jury verdict, or whether it results from the operation of some other rule that discharges the accused
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other countries, the prosecuting authority may appeal an acquittal similar to how a defendant may appeal a conviction

The family Acrasidae (ICZN, or Acrasiomycota, ICBN) is a family of slime molds which belongs to the protist group Percolozoa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name acrasio- comes from the Greek Akrasia, meaning "acting against one's judgement"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This group consists of cellular slime molds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some would also consider it as a kingdom unto itself, but the debate is as yet unsettled
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The terms "Acrasiomycota" or "Acrasiomycetes" have been used when the group was believed to be a fungus ("-mycota")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some classifications, Dictyostelium was placed in Acrasiomycetes, an artificial group of cellular slime molds, which was characterized by the aggregation of individual amoebae into a multicellular fruiting body, making it an important factor that related the acrasids to the dictyostelids

The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is defined as the area of 1 chain by 1 furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to  1⁄640 of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047 m2, or about 40% of a hectare

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H+), or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the solute
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Acrididae are the predominant family of grasshoppers, comprising some 10,000 of the 11,000 species of the entire suborder Caelifera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Acrididae are best known because all locusts (swarming grasshoppers) are of the Acrididae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The subfamily Oedipodinae is sometimes classified as a distinct family Oedipodidae in the superfamily Acridoidea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrididae grasshoppers are characterized by relatively short and stout antennae, and tympana on the side of the first abdominal segment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acridotheres is a genus of starlings, the "typical" mynas, which are tropical members of the family Sturnidae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This genus has representatives in tropical southern Asia from Iran east to southern China and Indonesia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two species have been introduced widely elsewhere
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The common myna has been introduced to South Africa, Israel, Hawaii, North America, Australia and New Zealand, and the crested myna to the Vancouver region of British Columbia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Acridotheres mynas are generally dark or dull birds with and fluted calls like most starlings; the sexes are similar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They walk rather than hop, and have modifications to the skull and its muscles for open bill probing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They resemble the hill mynas (Gracula) with which they often co-occur, in having large white or buff wing patches which are obvious in flight and in some also naked areas on the head, but differ in that only the head plumage is glossy, and the underparts tend to be paler
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The naked head patches are different in arrangement
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acridotheres mynas are also much more terrestrial than Gracula
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They have bowing courtship displays, whereas Gracula has no visual display
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They lay unmarked pale blue eggs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Several species have frontal crests which become covered with pollen when the birds take nectar from flowers, and may play a role in pollination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Like most starlings, the Acridotheres mynas are fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer (polyacrylonitrile) with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For a fiber to be called "acrylic" in the US, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 DuPont created the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name Orlon
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was first developed in the mid-1940s but was not produced in large quantities until the 1950s
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Strong and warm, acrylic fiber is often used for sweaters and tracksuits and as linings for boots and gloves, as well as in furnishing fabrics and carpets
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is manufactured as a filament, then cut into short staple lengths similar to wool hairs, and spun into yarn
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Modacrylic is a modified acrylic fiber that contains at least 35% and at most 85% acrylonitrile monomer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The comonomers vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride or vinyl bromide used in modacrylic give the fiber flame retardant properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 End-uses of modacrylic include faux fur, wigs, hair extensions and protective clothing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Hatred or hate is a deep and extreme emotional dislike
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be directed against individuals, groups, entities, objects, behaviors, or ideas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Hatred is often associated with feelings of anger, disgust and a disposition towards hostility
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acrimony was a British heavy metal band who were active during the 1990s
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Releasing their debut album in 1994, they are regarded as the pioneers of stoner metal in the United Kingdom, and an important influence upon the scene
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although the band never achieved mainstream success, during their career they received much critical acclaim – they were nominated for the Kerrang! Best Newcomer award and earned top review ratings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrimony have maintained a cult following in the British metal scene, their records reportedly selling for vast sums as collectors items
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 AlMusic described their musical style as "typical mid-'90s stoner rock" that "combined Black Sabbath's heavy metal riffery, Hawkwind's space rock excursions, and Blue Cheer's fuzzed-out psychedelic feedback with extreme doses of volume 
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Acritic songs (Greek: Ακριτικά τραγούδια "frontiersmen songs") are the heroic or epic poetry that emerged in the Byzantine Empire probably around the 9th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The songs celebrated the exploits of the Akrites, the frontier guards defending the eastern borders of the Byzantine Empire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The historical background was the almost continuous Byzantine-Arab conflict between the 7th and 12th centuries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Against this background several romances were produced, the most famous of which is that of Digenis Acritas, considered by some to signal the beginnings of modern Greek literature

Acraea (Ancient Greek: Ἀκραία) was a name that had several uses in Greek and Roman mythology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea was a daughter of the river-god Asterion near Mycenae, who together with her sisters Euboea and Prosymna (Πρόσυμνα) acted as nurses to Hera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A hill Acraea opposite the temple of Hera near Mycenae derived its name from her
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea and Acraeus are also epithets given to various goddesses and gods whose temples were situated upon hills, such as Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite, Pallas, Artemis, and others

Acrobatics (from Greek ἀκροβατέω akrobateō, "walk on tiptoe, strut") is the performance of extraordinary human feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities — such as ballet and diving — may also employ acrobatics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics

Aristotle (; Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης, pronounced [aristotélɛːs], Aristotélēs; 384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 347 BC)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of Aristotle's zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In metaphysics, Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Jewish and Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim scholars, and has been revered as "The First Teacher" (Arabic: المعلم الأول‎‎)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues – Cicero described his literary style as "a river of gold" – it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived

The centromere is the part of a chromosome that links sister chromatids or a dyad
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Centromeres were first thought to be genetic loci that direct the behavior of chromosomes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The physical role of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly of the kinetochore – a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation – i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 binding microtubules and signalling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion and for cells to enter anaphase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are, broadly speaking, two types of centromeres
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Point centromeres" bind to specific proteins that recognise particular DNA sequences with high efficiency
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Any piece of DNA with the point centromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centromere if present in the appropriate species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The best characterised point centromeres are those of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Regional centromeres" is the term coined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of preferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid ) sequences as well
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be epigenetic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, have regional centromeres
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Regarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical sister chromatids are most closely in contact
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication in chromatin form) are linked along their length by the action of the cohesin complex
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Rhodanthe, also known as sunray or pink paper daisy, is a genus of Australian plants in the pussy's-toes tribe within the daisy family
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


The name Rhodanthe is derived from Greek rhodon, rose and anthos, flower

Many Rhodanthe species were formerly classed under different genera, including Helipterum, Podotheca, Acroclinium and Waitzia

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acrocomia is a genus of palms which is native to the Neotropics, ranging from Mexico in the north, through Central America and the Caribbean, and through South America south to Argentina
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acrocyanosis is persistent blue or cyanotic discoloration of the extremities, most commonly occurring in the hands, although it also occurs in the feet and distal parts of face
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
   Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The very term "acrocyanosis" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a benign cosmetic condition, sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, frostbite differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud’s phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, blue finger syndrome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acrocyanosis may be a sign of a more serious medical problem, such as connective tissue diseases and diseases associated with central cyanosis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other causative conditions include infections, toxicities, antiphospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, neoplasms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In these cases, the observed cutaneous changes are known as "secondary acrocyanosis"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They may have a less symmetric distribution and may be associated with pain and tissue loss
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A cryptogam (scientific name Cryptogamae) is a plant (in the wide sense of the word) that reproduces by spores, without flowers or seeds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 "Cryptogamae" (Greek κρυπτός kryptos, "hidden" + γαμέω, gameein, "to marry") means hidden reproduction, referring to the fact that no seed is produced, thus cryptogams represent the non-seed bearing plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other names, such as "thallophytes", "lower plants", and "spore plants" are also occasionally used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a group, Cryptogamae are the opposite of the Phanerogamae (Greek φανερός, phaneros = "visible") or Spermatophyta (Greek σπέρμα, sperma = "seed" and φυτόν, phyton = "plant"), the seed plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The best known groups of cryptogams are algae, lichens, mosses and ferns, but it also includes non-photosynthetic organisms traditionally classified as plants, such as fungi, slime molds, and bacteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The classification is now deprecated in Linnaean taxonomy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

At one time, the cryptogams were formally recognised as a group within the plant kingdom
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In his system for classification of all known plants and animals, Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, one of which was the "Cryptogamia"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This included all plants with concealed reproductive organs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He divided Cryptogamia into four orders: Algae, Musci (bryophytes), Filices (ferns), and Fungi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Not all cryptogams are treated as part of the plant kingdom; the fungi, in particular, are regarded as a separate kingdom, more closely related to animals than plants, while blue-green algae are now regarded as a phylum of bacteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Therefore, in contemporary plant systematics, "Cryptogamae" is not a taxonomically coherent group, but is cladistically polyphyletic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, all organisms known as cryptogams belong to the field traditionally studied by botanists and the names of all cryptogams are regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

During World War II, the Government Code and Cypher School recruited Geoffrey Tandy, a marine biologist expert in cryptogams, to Station X, Bletchley Park when someone confused these with cryptograms

Acrobatics (from Greek ἀκροβατέω akrobateō, "walk on tiptoe, strut") is the performance of extraordinary human feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities — such as ballet and diving — may also employ acrobatics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acromegaly is a disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates have closed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There may also be enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acromegaly is typically due to the pituitary gland producing too much growth hormone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The condition is not inherited from a person's parents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Rarely acromegaly is due to tumors in other parts of the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has drunk glucose or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 After diagnosis, medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to look for an adenoma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood the result is gigantism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, medications, and radiation therapy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Surgery is usually the preferred treatment and is most effective when the tumor is smaller
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In those in whom surgery is not effective, medications of the somatostatin analogue or GH receptor antagonist type may be used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The effects of radiation therapy are more gradual than that of surgery or medication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Without treatment those affected live on average 10 years less; however, with treatment life expectancy is typically normal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acromegaly affects about 6 per 100,000 people
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Males and females are affected with equal frequency
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The first medical description of the disorder occurred in 1772 by Nicolas Saucerotte
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term is from Greek ἄκρον akron meaning "extremity" and μέγα mega meaning "large"

The term Mongolian idiocy and similar terms have been used to refer to a specific type of mental deficiency associated with the genetic disorder now more commonly referred to as Down syndrome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The use of these terms has largely been abandoned because of their offensive and misleading implications about those with the disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

English physician John Langdon Down first characterized the syndrome that now bears his name as a separate form of mental disability in 1862, and in a more widely published report in 1866
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to his perception that children with Down syndrome shared facial similarities with the populations that Johann Friedrich Blumenbach described as the "Mongolian race", Down used the term mongoloid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mongolism and its Pathology was the title used by W
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Bertram Hill for a published study in 1908 and the term mongolism was used by psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose as late as 1961
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The racist connotations of the term were both popularized and exacerbated by F
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 G
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Crookshank in a long-discredited work of scientific racism entitled The Mongol in our Midst first published in 1924
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1961, a prestigious group of genetic experts wrote a joint letter to the medical journal The Lancet which read:

It has long been recognised that the terms Mongolian Idiocy, Mongolism, Mongoloid, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 as applied to a specific type of mental deficiency have misleading connotations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The importance of this anomaly among Europeans and their descendants is not related to the segregation of genes derived from Asians; its appearance among members of Asian populations suggests such ambiguous designations as 'Mongol Mongoloid'; increasing participation of Chinese and Japanese in investigation of the condition imposes on them the use of an embarrassing term
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 We urge, therefore, that the expressions which imply a racial aspect of the condition be no longer used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of the undersigned are inclined to replace the term Mongolism by such designations as 'Langdon Down Anomaly', or 'Down's Syndrome or Anomaly', or 'Congenital Acromicria'
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several of us believe that this is an appropriate time to introduce the term 'Trisomy 21 Anomaly', which would include cases of simple Trisomy as well as translocations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is hoped that agreement on a specific phrase will soon crystallise once the term 'Mongolism' has been abandoned
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


The World Health Organization (WHO) resolved to abandon the term in 1965 at the request of the Mongolian People's Republic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Despite several decades of inaction and resistance, the term thereafter began to fade from use, in favor of the term such as Down's Syndrome, Down syndrome and Trisomy 21 disorder
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Steven J
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Gould reported in 1980 that the term "mongolism" still remained in common use in the United States, despite its being "defamatory" and "wrong on all counts"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the 21st century, all the older terms are considered unacceptable in the English-speaking world, are no longer in common use, and have been largely forgotten
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In French, "mongolisme" is still in common use in the media to refer to Down syndrome

In human anatomy, the acromion (from Greek: akros, "highest", ōmos, "shoulder", plural: acromia) is a bony process on the scapula (shoulder blade)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Together with the coracoid process it extends laterally over the shoulder joint
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The acromion is a continuation of the scapular spine, and hooks over anteriorly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It articulates with the clavicle (collar bone) to form the acromioclavicular joint

An acronym is a word or name formed as an abbreviation from the initial components in a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in NATO or laser) and sometimes syllables (as in Benelux), that can be pronounced as a word
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are no universal standards of the multiple names for such abbreviations and of their orthographic styling
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending

Acrophobia (from the Greek: ἄκρον, ákron, meaning "peak, summit, edge" and φόβος, phóbos, "fear") is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar causes and options for treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A head for heights is advantageous for those hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g

Acropora is a genus of small polyp stony coral in the phylum Cnidaria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some of its species are known as table coral, elkhorn coral, and staghorn coral
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over 149 species are described
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acropora species are some of the major reef corals responsible for building the immense calcium carbonate substructure that supports the thin living skin of a reef
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The acrosome is an organelle that develops over the anterior half of the head in the spermatozoa (sperm cells) of many animals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a cap-like structure derived from the Golgi apparatus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrosome formation is fully completed 5–10 years after testicular maturation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Eutherian mammals the acrosome contains digestive enzymes (including hyaluronidase and acrosin)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These enzymes break down the outer membrane of the ovum, called the zona pellucida, allowing the haploid nucleus in the sperm cell to join with the haploid nucleus in the ovum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This shedding of the acrosome, or acrosome reaction, can be stimulated in vitro by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally such as progesterone or follicular fluid, as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This can be done to serve as a positive control when assessing the acrosome reaction of a sperm sample by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC-PNA, FITC-PSA, FITC-ConA, or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC-CD46
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


In the case of globozoospermia (sperm with round heads), the Golgi apparatus is not transformed into the acrosome, causing male infertility

An acrostic is a poem (or other form of writing) in which the first letter (or syllable, or word) of each line (or paragraph, or other recurring feature in the text) spells out a word, message or the alphabet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word comes from the French acrostiche from post-classical Latin acrostichis, from Koine Greek ἀκροστιχίς, from Ancient Greek ἄκρος "highest, topmost" and στίχος "verse")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a mnemonic device to aid memory retrieval
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Relatively simple acrostics may merely spell out the letters of the alphabet in order; such an acrostic may be called an 'alphabetical acrostic' or Abecedarius
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These acrostics occur in the first four of the five songs that make up the Book of Lamentations, in the praise of the good wife in Proverbs 31, 10-31, and in Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119 and 145 of the Hebrew Bible
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Notable among the acrostic Psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and Psalm 145, which is recited three times a day in the Jewish services
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 E
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Psalm 25 one Hebrew letter is not represented, the following letter (Resh) repeated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Psalm 34 the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but makes line too long
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Psalms 37 and 111 the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfering with each other; as a result in Psalm 37, for the letters Daleth and Kaph there is only one verse, and the letter Ayin is not represented
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Psalm 111 and 112 have 22 lines, but 10 verses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Psalm 145 does not represent the letter Nun, having 21 one verses, but one Qumran manuscript of this Psalm does have that missing line, which agrees with the Septuagint
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acrostics prove that the texts in question were originally composed in writing, rather than having existed in oral tradition before being put into writing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acrostics are common in medieval literature, where they usually serve to highlight the name of the poet or his patron, or to make a prayer to a saint
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are most frequent in verse works but can also appear in prose
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Middle High German poet Rudolf von Ems for example opens all his great works with an acrostic of his name, and his world chronicle marks the beginning of each age with an acrostic of the key figure (Moses, David, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In chronicles, acrostics are common in German and English but rare in other languages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Often the ease of detectability of an acrostic can depend on the intention of its creator
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some cases an author may desire an acrostic to have a better chance of being perceived by an observant reader, such as the acrostic contained in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (where the key capital letters are decorated with ornate embellishments)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, acrostics may also be used as a form of steganography, where the author seeks to conceal the message rather than proclaim it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This might be achieved by making the key letters uniform in appearance with the surrounding text, or by aligning the words in such a way that the relationship between the key letters is less obvious
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is referred to as null ciphers in steganography, using the first letter of each word to form a hidden message in an otherwise innocuous text
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Using letters to hide a message, as in acrostic ciphers, was popular during the Renaissance, and could employ various methods of enciphering, such as selecting other letters than initials based on a repeating pattern (equidistant letter sequences), or even concealing the message by starting at the end of the text and working backwards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acrostichum is a fern genus in the Ceratopteridoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was one of the original pteridophyte genera delineated by Linnaeus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was originally drawn very broadly, including all ferns that had sori apparently "acrostichoid", or distributed in a uniform mass across the back of the frond, rather than organized in discrete sori
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This led Linnaeus to include such species as Asplenium platyneuron in the genus, because the specimen he received had sori so crowded that it appeared acrostichoid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Since Acrostichum aureum is regarded as the type for the genus, it is now narrowly circumscribed only to the natural genus of three species, that are allied to the genus Ceratopteris
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are collectively known as the leather ferns or leather swamp ferns, genus members commonly being found in swamps
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The species of Acrostichum are massive ferns, with fronds up to 12 feet (3
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
5 meters) tall, that depend on a semi-aquatic existence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They do not withstand prolonged immersion, but require wet roots
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The species Acrostichum aureum is known to have a high saltwater tolerance, growing in mangroves

 The software is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is used in B2B services and corporate sales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

CATI may function in the following manner:
A computerized questionnaire is administered to respondents over the telephone
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The interviewer sits in front of a computer screen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Upon command, the computer dials the telephone number to be called
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

When contact is made, the interviewer reads the questions posed on the computer screen and records the respondent's answers directly into the computer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Interim and update reports can be compiled instantaneously, as the data are being collected
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

CATI software has built-in logic, which also enhances data accuracy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The program will personalize questions and control for logically incorrect answers, such as percentage answers that do not add up to 100 percent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The software has built-in branching logic, which will skip questions that are not applicable or will probe for more detail when warranted

Actias is a genus of Saturniid moths, which contains the Asian-American moon moths
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Long tails on their hindwings are among their distinctive traits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other moths with similar appearance are Copiopteryx, Argema and Eudaemonia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The majority of species in this genus feed on the leaves of sweetgum, pine, or similar trees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As with all Saturniids, adult Actias moths lack functional mouthparts so their lifespan after emergence from the cocoon only ranges from a few days to a week
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actifed is a registered trademark for a combination antihistamine and nasal decongestant medication used for cold and allergy symptoms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Developed in 1958 by Burroughs Wellcome & Company (now part of GlaxoSmithKline), the product was later acquired by Pfizer, and was most recently sold by Johnson & Johnson
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the U

Actin is a family of globular multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells (the only known exception being nematode sperm), where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 μM
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An actin protein's mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7 nm, and it is the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actin participates in many important cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A cell’s ability to dynamically form microfilaments provides the scaffolding that allows it to rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to the organism’s internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane absorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other enzymes or organelles such as cilia can be anchored to this scaffolding in order to control the deformation of the external cell membrane, which allows endocytosis and cytokinesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help of molecular motors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actin therefore contributes to processes such as the intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles as well as muscular contraction and cellular migration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It therefore plays an important role in embryogenesis, the healing of wounds and the invasivity of cancer cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The evolutionary origin of actin can be traced to prokaryotic cells, which have equivalent proteins
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actin homologs from prokaryotes and archaea polymerize into different helical or linear filaments consisting of one or multiple strands
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However the in-strand contacts and nucleotide binding sites are preserved in prokaryotes and in archaea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lastly, actin plays an important role in the control of gene expression
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A large number of illnesses and diseases are caused by mutations in alleles of the genes that regulate the production of actin or of its associated proteins
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The production of actin is also key to the process of infection by some pathogenic microorganisms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mutations in the different genes that regulate actin production in humans can cause muscular diseases, variations in the size and function of the heart as well as deafness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The make-up of the cytoskeleton is also related to the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria and viruses, particularly in the processes related to evading the actions of the immune system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Ambulacral is a term typically used in the context of anatomical parts of the phylum Echinodermata or class Asteroidea and Edrioasteroidea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Echinoderms can have ambulacral parts that include ossicles, plates, spines, and suckers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, sea stars or "star fish" have an ambulacral groove on their oral side (underside)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This ambulacral groove extends from the mouth to the end of each ray or arm
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each groove of each arm in turn has four rows of hollow tube feet that can be extended or withdrawn
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Opposite the ambulacral groove is an ambulacral ridge on the aboral side of each ray, known as an ambulacrum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These have interambulacra between them
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: ὑπόκρισις, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actinia is a genus of sea anemones in the family Actiniidae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Sea anemones are a group of marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are named for the anemone, a terrestrial flowering plant, because of their colourful appearance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the surface of the water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through the mouth into the sea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, settle on the seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actinism () is the property of solar radiation that leads to the production of photochemical and photobiological effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinism is derived from the Greek ακτίς, ακτῖνος (a ray or beam)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The word actinism is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and chemistry (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in chemical photography and X-ray imaging
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actinic () chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actinidia  is a genus of woody and, with a few exceptions, dioecious plants native to temperate eastern Asia, occurring throughout most of China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, and extending north to southeast Siberia and south into Indochina
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The genus includes shrubs growing to 6 m (20 ft) tall, and vigorous, strong-growing vines, growing up to 30 m (98 ft) in tree canopies
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They mostly tolerate temperatures down to around −15°C (5°F), and some are much hardier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The leaves are alternate and simple, with a dentated margin and a long petiole
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The flowers are solitary or in axillary cymes, usually white, with five small petals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most of the species are dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some are monoecious
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The fruit is a large berry containing numerous small seeds; in most species, the fruit is edible
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In particular, this genus is known for the species Actinidia deliciosa, the kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry, and for the hardy ornamental A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 kolomikta
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Actinidiaceae are a small family of flowering plants commonly known as the Chinese gooseberry family
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family has three genera and about 360 species and is a member of the order Ericales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actinium is a chemical element with symbol Ac and atomic number 89
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period transition metals, although lawrencium is less commonly given that position
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Discovered in 1899, it was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
15 hours
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reactor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The actinide  or actinoid  (IUPAC nomenclature) series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Strictly speaking, both actinium and lawrencium have been labeled as group 3 elements, but both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the actinide elements
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinium is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since "actinide" means "like actinium", it has been argued that actinium cannot logically be a actinide, even though IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the proceeding element
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

All actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Of the actinides, primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium, and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The other actinides are purely synthetic elements
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods)

Verbesina, or crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants, in the daisy family (Asteraceae)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a large genus of over 300 species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

All the species bear yellow flowers similar to small sunflowers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name Verbesina very likely refers to the similarity of the foliage to that of the (unrelated) Verbena
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Verbesina species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These include Schinia bina, which has been recorded from V
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 encelioides, and Schinia siren which feeds exclusively on that species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actinometers are instruments used to measure the heating power of radiation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are used in meteorology to measure solar radiation as pyranometers, pyrheliometers and net radiometers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An actinometer is a chemical system or physical device which determines the number of photons in a beam integrally or per unit time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This name is commonly applied to devices used in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength ranges
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, solutions of iron(III) oxalate can be used as a chemical actinometer, while bolometers, thermopiles, and photodiodes are physical devices giving a reading that can be correlated to the number of photons detected
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A solarimeter is a pyranometer, a type of measuring device used to measure combined direct and diffuse solar radiation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An integrating solarimeter measures energy developed from solar radiation based on the absorption of heat by a black body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The principle this instrument was designed on was first developed by the Italian priest, Father Angelo Bellani
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He invented the actinometric method which is based on physical and chemical techniques

Floral symmetry describes whether, and how, a flower, in particular its perianth, can be divided into two or more identical or mirror-image parts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Uncommonly, flowers may have no axis of symmetry at all, typically because their parts are spirally arranged
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actinomyces is a genus of the Actinobacteria class of bacteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are all gram-positive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinomyces species are facultatively anaerobic (except A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 meyeri and A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 israelii both obligate anaerobe), and they grow best under anaerobic conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actinomyces species may form endospores, and, while individual bacteria are rod-shaped, Actinomyces colonies form fungus-like branched networks of hyphae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The aspect of these colonies initially led to the incorrect assumption that the organism was a fungus and to the name Actinomyces, "ray fungus" (from Greek actis, ray, beam and mykes, fungus)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actinomyces species are ubiquitous, occurring in soil and in the microbiota of animals, including the human microbiota
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are known for the important role they play in soil ecology; they produce a number of enzymes that help degrade organic plant material, lignin, and chitin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thus their presence is important in the formation of compost
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Certain species are commensal in the skin flora, oral flora, gut flora, and vaginal flora of humans and livestock
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are also known for causing diseases in humans and livestock, usually when they get an opportunity to gain access to the body's interior through wounds
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As with other opportunistic infections, people with immunodeficiency are at higher risk
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In all of the preceding traits and in their branching filament formation, they bear similarities to Nocardia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Like various other anaerobes, Actinomyces species are fastidious and thus not easy to culture and isolate
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Clinical laboratories do culture and isolate them, but a negative result does not rule out infection, because it may be due simply to reluctance to grow in vitro
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The Actinomycetales are an order of Actinobacteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A member of the order is often called an actinomycete
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actinomycetes are very diverse and contain a variety of subdivisions, as well as yet-unclassified isolates, mainly because some genera are very difficult to classify because of a highly niche-dependent phenotype
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, Nocardia contains several phenotypes first believed to be distinct species before their differences were shown to be entirely dependent on their growth conditions

Dactinomycin, also known as actinomycin D, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This includes Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, trophoblastic neoplasm, testicular cancer, and certain types of ovarian cancer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is given by injection into a vein
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Most people develop side effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, mouth ulcers, hair loss, liver problems, infections, and muscle pains
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other serious side effects include future cancers, allergic reactions, and tissue death at the site of injection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Use in pregnancy may harm the baby
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Dactinomycin is in the cytotoxic antibiotic family of medications
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is believed to work by blocking the creation of RNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Dactinomycin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 24
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
73 USD per 500 mcg vial
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is produced from bacteria Streptomyces parvullus

Actinomycosis is a rare infectious bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 About 70% of infections are due to either Actinomyces israelii or A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 gerencseriae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Infection can also be caused by other Actinomyces species, as well as Propionibacterium propionicus, which presents similar symptoms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The condition is likely to be polymicrobial aerobic anaerobic infection

Max Auerbach (26 January 1879 in Elberfeld – 21 November 1968 in Karlsruhe-Durlach) was a German zoologist known for his research of Cnidospora
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

From 1897 to 1902, he studied medicine and zoology at the University of Basel, where following graduation, he served as an assistant to Friedrich Zschokke (1860–1936)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Soon afterwards, he obtained his habilitation in zoology and anthropology at the Technischen Hochschule Karlsruhe (1904)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Karlsruhe, he gave lectures at the technical school (until 1934) and also at the Hochschule der Bildenden Künste Karlsruhe (1926–1945)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1918 he was named director of the Badische Landessammlungen für Naturkunde (Baden State Collections of Natural History), and during the following year, founded the Anstalt für Bodenseeforschung der Stadt Konstanz (Max Auerbach Institute) in Konstanz

An amoeba (/əˈmiːbə/; rarely spelled amœba, US English rarely spelled ameba; plural am(o)ebas or am(o)ebae /əˈmiːbiː/), often called amoeboid, is a type of cell or organism which has the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting pseudopods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Amoebas do not form a single taxonomic group; instead, they are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic organisms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Amoeboid cells occur not only among the protozoa, but also in fungi, algae, and animals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Microbiologists often use the terms "amoeboid" and "amoeba" interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In older classification systems, most amoebas were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Sarcodina is not a monophyletic group whose members share common descent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Consequently, amoeboid organisms are no longer classified together in one group
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The best known amoeboid protists are the "giant amoebae" Chaos carolinense and Amoeba proteus, both of which are widely cultivated and studied in classrooms and laboratories
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other well known species include the so-called "brain-eating amoeba" Naegleria fowleri, the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery, and the multicellular "social amoeba" or slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum

In the law, a cause of action is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right to sue to obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against another party
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings suit (such as breach of contract, battery, or false imprisonment)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The legal document which carries a claim is often called a Statement of Claim in English law, or a Complaint in U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 federal practice and in many U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 states
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an alleged fault which resulted in damages, often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay/reimburse
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To pursue a cause of action, a plaintiff pleads or alleges facts in a complaint, the pleading that initiates a lawsuit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A cause of action generally encompasses both the legal theory (the legal wrong the plaintiff claims to have suffered) and the remedy (the relief a court is asked to grant)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Often the facts or circumstances that entitle a person to seek judicial relief may create multiple causes of action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although it is fairly straightforward to file a Statement of Claim in most jurisdictions, if it is not done properly, then the filing party may lose his case due to simple technicalities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are a number of specific causes of action, including: contract-based actions; statutory causes of action; torts such as assault, battery, invasion of privacy, fraud, slander, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress; and suits in equity such as unjust enrichment and quantum meruit
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The points a plaintiff must prove to win a given type of case are called the "elements" of that cause of action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, for a claim of negligence, the elements are: the (existence of a) duty, breach (of that duty), proximate cause (by that breach), and damages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If a complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support every element of a claim, the court, upon motion by the opposing party, may dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The defendant to a cause of action must file an "Answer" to the complaint in which the claims can be admitted or denied (including denial on the basis of insufficient information in the complaint to form a response)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The answer may also contain counterclaims in which the "Counterclaim Plaintiff" states its own causes of action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Finally, the answer may contain affirmative defenses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most defenses must be raised at the first possible opportunity either in the answer or by motion or are deemed waived
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A few defenses, in particular a court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction, need not be pleaded and may be raised at any time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actitis is a small genus of waders, comprising just two very similar bird species:
Common sandpiper, Actitis hypoleucos, of Eurasia
Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia of North America
The genus name Actitis is from Ancient Greek aktites, "coast-dweller" from akte, "coast"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These are both small migratory waders, greyish brown on top and white underneath, with a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The plumages are very similar, apart from spotted sandpipers' distinctive breeding plumage, and suspected out-of-range vagrants must be carefully observed for identification to species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Both species have short yellow or yellowish legs and a medium bill
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These are not gregarious birds and are seldom seen in large flocks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They nest on the ground, and their habitat is near fresh water
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These birds forage on the ground or in water, picking up food by sight
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They may also catch insects in flight
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They eat insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actitis is part of the shank-tattler-phalarope clade and less closely related to the calidrid sandpipers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Based on the degree of DNA sequence divergence and putative shank and phalarope fossils from around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary some 23-22 million years ago, presumably Actitis diverged from its closest relatives in the Late Oligocene; given the much higher diversity of the prehistoric members of the group in Eurasia it is likely that they originated there, possibly being isolated as the remains of the Turgai Sea dried up, which happened just around this time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Late Pliocene fossil described as Actitis balcanica  appears to be actually from some indeterminate charadriid
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Actium (Greek: Ἄκτιον) was the name of an ancient town on a promontory of western Greece in northwestern Acarnania, at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actium is chiefly famous as the name given to the nearby naval Battle of Actium, in which Octavian won a decisive victory over Mark Antony on September 2, 31 BC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actium was situated on the southern side of the strait opposite the later city of Nicopolis built by Octavian
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since 2002 the peninsular of Actium has been linked with Preveza on the north shore of the Ambracian Gulf by the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel

The reticular activating system (RAS), also known as the extrathalamic control modulatory system, is a set of connected nuclei in the brains of vertebrates that is responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep-wake transitions, and also for promoting motor control of posture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a part of the reticular formation, and includes other brainstem nuclei including the locus coeruleus and some of the raphe nuclei
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The reticular activation system includes ascending pathways to the cortex in the ascending reticular activating system, and descending pathways to the spinal cord in the descending reticular activating system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Activation in (bio-)chemical sciences generally refers to the process whereby something is prepared or excited for a subsequent reaction

Activism consists of efforts to promote, impede, or direct social, political, economic, or environmental reform or stasis with the desire to make improvements in society
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Forms of activism range from writing letters to newspapers or to politicians, political campaigning, economic activism such as boycotts or preferentially patronizing businesses, rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, and hunger strikes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

One can also express activism through different forms of art (artivism)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Daily acts of protest such as not buying clothes from a certain clothing company because they exploit workers is another form of activism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One view holds that acknowledging privileges and oppressions on a daily basis ranks as a form of activism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Research has begun to explore how activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Online Etymology Dictionary records the English words "activism" and "activist" (in the political sense) from 1920 and from 1915 respectively

A myofibril (also known as a muscle fibril) is a basic rod-like unit of a muscle cell
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Muscles are composed of tubular cells called myocytes, known as muscle fibers in striated muscle, and these cells in turn contain many chains of myofibrils
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are created during embryonic development in a process known as myogenesis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Myofibrils are composed of long proteins including actin, myosin, and titin, and other proteins that hold them together
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These proteins are organized into thick and thin filaments called myofilaments, which repeat along the length of the myofibril in sections called sarcomeres
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Muscles contract by sliding the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments along each other
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An actor (often actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who answers"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When used for the stage, women occasionally played the roles of prepubescent boys

Acts of the Apostles (Ancient Greek: Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων, Práxeis tôn Apostólōn; Latin: Actūs Apostolōrum), often referred to simply as Acts, is the fifth book of the New Testament; it tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman Empire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work, Luke–Acts, by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80–90 AD
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with Jesus's Ascension to Heaven
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The early chapters, set in Jerusalem, describe the Day of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the Apostle Peter the message is taken to the Gentiles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Luke–Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Luke–Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or "apology" for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans featuring as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews, and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah

Not the Actual Events is an extended play by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was released physically on December 23, 2016, under Trent Reznor's own label The Null Corporation, while those who had pre-ordered received a download link a day early
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The second Nine Inch Nails EP of original material following Broken in 1992, it marks long-time collaborator Atticus Ross's first appearance as an official member of the band
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The digital pre-orders included a "physical component" that was shipped in early March 2017
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that Not The Actual Events would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment entitled Add Violence being released July 2017, and the third and final EP of the trilogy expected by the end of 2017
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In philosophy, potentiality and actuality are principles of a dichotomy which Aristotle used to analyze motion, causality, ethics, and physiology in his Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics and De Anima, which is about the human psyche
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The concept of potentiality, in this context, generally refers to any "possibility" that a thing can be said to have
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aristotle did not consider all possibilities the same, and emphasized the importance of those that become real of their own accord when conditions are right and nothing stops them
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a possibility becomes real in the fullest sense
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These concepts, in modified forms, remained very important into the middle ages, influencing the development of medieval theology in several ways
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Going further into modern times, while the understanding of nature and, according to some interpretations, deity implied by the dichotomy lost importance, the terminology has found new uses, developing indirectly from the old
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is most obvious in words like "energy" and "dynamic"--words first used in modern physics by the German scientist and philosopher, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Another example is the biological concept of an "entelechy"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Self-actualization is a term that has been used in various psychology theories, often in slightly different ways
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term was originally introduced by the organismic theorist Kurt Goldstein for the motive to realize one's full potential
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Expressing one's creativity, quest for spiritual enlightenment, pursuit of knowledge, and the desire to give to and/or positively transform society are examples of self-actualization
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Goldstein's view, it is the organism's master motive, the only real motive: "the tendency to actualize itself as fully as possible is the basic drive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 the drive of self-actualization
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" Carl Rogers similarly wrote of "the curative force in psychotherapy – man's tendency to actualize himself, to become his potentialities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 to express and activate all the capacities of the organism
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" The concept was brought most fully to prominence in Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory as the final level of psychological development that can be achieved when all basic and mental needs are essentially fulfilled and the "actualization" of the full personal potential takes place, although he adapted this viewpoint later on in life, and saw it more flexibly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Self-actualization can be seen as similar to words and concepts such as self-discovery, self-reflection, self-realization and self-exploration
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As Abraham Maslow noted, the basic needs of humans must be met (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 food, shelter, warmth, security, sense of belonging) before a person can achieve self-actualization – the need to be good, to be fully alive and to find meaning in life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Yet, Maslow argued that reaching a state of true self-actualization in everyday society was fairly rare
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Research shows that when people live lives that are different from their true nature and capabilities, they are less likely to be happy than those whose goals and lives match
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, someone who has inherent potential to be a great artist or teacher may never realize his/her talents if their energy is focused on attaining the basic needs of humans
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actually (stylised as Pet Shop Boys, actually
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) is the second album by English pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 7 September 1987 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom and by EMI Manhattan in the United States and Canada
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to Neil Tennant and music historian Wayne Studer, the album is a loose critique of Thatcherism, the political zeitgeist of the 1980s, and had been recorded in anticipation of Margaret Thatcher's re-election
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actually is featured in the 2005 musical reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and in 2006 Q magazine placed the album at No

Actuarial science is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Actuaries are professionals who are qualified in this field through intense education and experience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including mathematics, probability theory, statistics, finance, economics, and computer science
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The science has gone through revolutionary changes during the last 30 years due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of stochastic actuarial models with modern financial theory (Frees 1990)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States (Needleman 2010)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A similar study by U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 News & World Report in 2006 included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future (Nemko 2006)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The actuarial credentialing and exam process usually requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, most often taking several years in total, before one can become recognized as a credentialed actuary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In others, such as the U
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
S
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure

An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system, for example by actuating (opening or closing) a valve; in simple terms, it is a "mover"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An actuator requires a control signal and a source of energy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, or even human power
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The supplied main energy source may be electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When the control signal is received, the actuator responds by converting the energy into mechanical motion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

An actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input

Acraea (Ancient Greek: Ἀκραία) was a name that had several uses in Greek and Roman mythology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea was a daughter of the river-god Asterion near Mycenae, who together with her sisters Euboea and Prosymna (Πρόσυμνα) acted as nurses to Hera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A hill Acraea opposite the temple of Hera near Mycenae derived its name from her
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acraea and Acraeus are also epithets given to various goddesses and gods whose temples were situated upon hills, such as Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite, Pallas, Artemis, and others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Aculeata is a subclade of Hymenoptera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is a reference to the defining feature of the group, which is the modification of the ovipositor into a stinger (thus, the group could be called "stinging wasps", though the group also contains the ants and the bees)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other words, the structure that was originally used to lay eggs is modified instead to deliver venom
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Not all members of the group can sting; a great many cannot, either because the ovipositor is modified in a different manner (such as for laying eggs in crevices), or because it is lost altogether
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This group includes the bees and ants and all of the eusocial Hymenopterans
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is commonly believed that the possession of a venomous sting was one of the important features promoting the evolution of social behavior, as it confers a level of anti-predator defense rarely approached by other invertebrates
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Aculeata is a subclade of Hymenoptera
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is a reference to the defining feature of the group, which is the modification of the ovipositor into a stinger (thus, the group could be called "stinging wasps", though the group also contains the ants and the bees)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other words, the structure that was originally used to lay eggs is modified instead to deliver venom
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Not all members of the group can sting; a great many cannot, either because the ovipositor is modified in a different manner (such as for laying eggs in crevices), or because it is lost altogether

The Butterfly Cluster (cataloged as Messier 6 or M6, and as NGC 6405) is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Scorpius
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its name derives from the vague resemblance of its shape to a butterfly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The first astronomer to record the Butterfly Cluster's existence was Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, Robert Burnham, Jr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 has proposed that the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy may have seen it with the naked eye while observing its neighbor the Ptolemy Cluster (M7)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Charles Messier catalogued the cluster as M6 in 1764 and it wasn't till the 20th century that star counts, distance, and other properties were measured

Baimaclia is a commune in Cantemir District, Moldova
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is composed of three villages: Acui, Baimaclia and Suhat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acupressure [from Latin acus "needle" (see acuity) + pressure (n
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)] is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through "meridians" in the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, for helping lower back pain, tension headaches, stomach ache, among other things, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Like many alternative medicines, it may benefit from a placebo effect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

According to Quackwatch, acupressure is a dubious practice and its practitioners use irrational methods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge, and acupuncture is a pseudoscience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the placebo effect
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as an adjunct to standard care, while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100 BC in China, around the time The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huangdi Neijing) was published, though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body's "rhythm" on the effectiveness of treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries, and then to Europe, starting with France
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves

In photography, the term "acutance" describes a subjective perception of sharpness that is related to the edge contrast of an image
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acutance is related to the amplitude of the derivative of brightness with respect to space
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to the nature of the human visual system, an image with higher acutance appears sharper even though an increase in acutance does not increase real resolution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Historically, acutance was enhanced chemically during development of a negative (High Acutance Developers), or by optical means in printing (Unsharp Masking)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In digital photography, onboard camera software and image postprocessing tools such as Photoshop or GIMP offer various sharpening facilities, the most widely used of which is known as "unsharp mask" because the algorithm is derived from the eponymous analog processing method
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the example image, two light gray lines were drawn on a gray background
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As the transition is instantaneous, the line is as sharp as can be represented at this resolution
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Acutance in the left line was artificially increased by adding a one-pixel-wide darker border on the outside of the line and a one-pixel-wide brighter border on the inside of the line
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The actual sharpness of the image is unchanged, but the apparent sharpness is increased because of the greater acutance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Artificially increased acutance has drawbacks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In this somewhat overdone example most viewers will also be able to see the borders separately from the line, which create two halos around the line, one dark and one shimmering bright

Aciclovir (ACV), also known as acyclovir, is an antiviral medication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is primarily used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections, chickenpox, and shingles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other uses include prevention of cytomegalovirus infections following transplant and severe complications of Epstein-Barr virus infection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It can be taken by mouth, applied as a cream, or injected
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Common side effects include nausea and diarrhea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Potentially serious side effects include kidney problems and low platelets
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Greater care is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is generally considered safe for use in pregnancy with no harm having been observed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It appears to be safe during breastfeeding
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aciclovir is a nucleic acid analogue made from guanosine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It works by decreasing the production of the virus's DNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The discovery of aciclovir was announced in 1977
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is available as a generic medication and is marketed under many brand names worldwide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The wholesale cost as of 2014 to 2016 was between US$0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
03 and US$0
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
12 for a typical dose by mouth
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The cost of a typical course of treatment in the United States is less than US$25
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The terms anno Domini (AD) and before Christ (BC) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term anno Domini is Medieval Latin and means "in the year of the Lord", but is often translated as "in the year of our Lord"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth, with AD counting years from the start of this epoch, and BC denoting years before the start of the era
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There is no year zero in this scheme, so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor, but was not widely used until after 800
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Traditionally, English followed Latin usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD 2017, but 68 BC), which also preserves syntactic order
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium, as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ, it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death, i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, after the death of Jesus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or Common Era (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Ad libitum () is Latin for "at one's pleasure" or "as you desire"; it is often shortened to "ad lib" (as an adjective or adverb) or "ad-lib" (as a verb or noun)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The roughly synonymous phrase a bene placito ("in accordance with [one's] good pleasure") is less common but, in its Italian form a piacere, entered the musical lingua franca (see below)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The phrase "at liberty" is often associated mnemonically (because of the alliteration of the lib- syllable), although it is not the translation (there is no cognation between libitum and liber)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Libido is the etymologically closer cognate known in English
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Agdistis is a genus of moth in the Pterophoridae family and only genus in the Agdistinae subfamily

Adam (Hebrew: אָדָם‎‎ [ʼādām]; Arabic: آدَم [ãdam]; Greek: Αδάμ [Athām/ Adām]) is the name used in the opening chapters of the Book of Genesis for the first man created by God, but it is also used in a collective sense as "mankind" and individually as "a human"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Biblical Adam (man, mankind) is created from adamah (earth), and Genesis 1-8 makes considerable play of the bond between them, for Adam is estranged from the earth through his disobedience
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adana (pronounced [aˈda
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
na]; Armenian: Ադանա) is a major city in southern Turkey
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The city is situated on the Seyhan river, 35 km (22 mi) inland from the Mediterranean, in south-central Anatolia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is the administrative seat of the Adana Province and has a population of 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 million, making it the fifth most populous city in Turkey
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Adana-Mersin polycentric metropolitan area, with a population of 3 million, stretches over 70 km (43 mi) east-west and 25 km (16 mi) north-south; encompassing the cities of Mersin, Tarsus and Adana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adana lies in the heart of Çukurova, a geo-cultural region alternatively known as Cilicia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Home to six million people, Çukurova is one of the largest population concentrations in Turkey, as well as the most agriculturally productive area, owing to its large stretch of flat, fertile land
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The region includes the provinces of Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye, and Hatay
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An adage (; Latin: adagium) is a short, usually philosophical, but memorable saying which holds some important fact of experience that is considered true by many people, or that has gained some credibility through its long memetic use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It often involves a planning failure such as "don't count your chickens before they hatch" or "don't burn your bridges"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adages may be interesting observations, practical or ethical guidelines, or skeptical comments on life
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some adages are products of folk wisdom that attempt to summarize some form of basic truth; these are generally known as proverbs or bywords
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An adage that describes a general rule of conduct is a "maxim"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A pithy expression that has not necessarily gained credit through long use, but is distinguished by particular depth or good style is an aphorism, while one distinguished by wit or irony is an epigram
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Through overuse, an adage may become a cliché or truism, or be described as an "old saw
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" Adages coined in modernity are often given proper names and called "laws" in imitation of physical laws, or "principles"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some adages, such as Murphy's Law, are first formulated informally and given proper names later, while others, such as the Peter Principle, have proper names in their initial formulation; it might be argued that the latter sort does not represent "true" adages, but the two types are often difficult to distinguish
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adages which were collected and used by ancient writers in their work and writings inspired the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus to publish his own collection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He would revise his moderate volume of 800 adages multiple times until the final edition of Adagia published in 1536 included over 4,000
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There have been many such collections since, usually in vernacular languages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adages formulated in popular works of fiction often find their way into popular culture, especially when there exists a subculture devoted to the work or its genre, as is the case with science fiction novels
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Many professions and subcultures create their own adages, which may be seen as a sort of jargon; such adages may find their way into popular usage, sometimes becoming altered in the process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Online communities, such as those that develop in Internet forums or Usenet newsgroups, are known for generating their own adages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adamant and similar words are used to refer to any especially hard substance, whether composed of diamond, some other gemstone, or some type of metal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Both adamant and diamond derive from the Greek word ἀδάμας, ἀδάμαντος (adamas, adamantos), meaning "untameable"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adamantite and adamantium (a metallic name derived from the Neo-Latin ending -ium) are also common variants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adamantine has, throughout ancient history, referred to anything that was made of a very hard material
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Virgil describes Tartarus as having a screeching gate protected by columns of solid adamantine (Aeneid book VI)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Later, by the Middle Ages, the term came to refer to diamond, as it was the hardest material then known
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It was in the Middle Ages, too, that adamantine hardness and the lodestone's magnetic properties became confused and combined, leading to an alternate definition in which "adamant" means magnet, falsely derived from the Latin adamare, which means to love or be attached to
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Another connection was the belief that adamant (the diamond definition) could block the effects of a magnet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This was addressed in chapter III of Pseudodoxia Epidemica, for instance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Since the word diamond is now used for the hardest gemstone, the increasingly archaic term "adamant" has a mostly poetic or figurative use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In that capacity, the name is frequently used in popular media and fiction to refer to a very hard substance

Baobab is the common name for each of the nine species of tree in the genus Adansonia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The generic name honours Michel Adanson, the French naturalist and explorer who described Adansonia digitata
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Of the nine species, six are native to Madagascar, two are native to mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and one is native to Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 One of the mainland African species also occurs on Madagascar, but it is not a native of that island
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was introduced in ancient times to south Asia and during the colonial era to the Caribbean
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also present in the island nation of Cape Verde
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The ninth species was described in 2012, and is found in upland populations of southern and eastern Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The African and Australian baobabs are almost identical despite having separated more than 100 million years ago, probably by oceanic dispersal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Baobabs reach heights of 5 to 30 m (16 to 98 ft) and have trunk diameters of 7 to 11 m (23 to 36 ft)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Glencoe baobab, a specimen of A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 digitata in Limpopo Province, South Africa, was considered to be the largest living individual, with a maximum circumference of 47 m (154 ft) and a diameter of about 15
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
9 m (52 ft)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The tree has since split into two parts, so the widest individual trunk may now be that of the Sunland baobab, or Platland tree, also in South Africa
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The diameter of this tree at ground level is 9
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
3 m (31 ft) and its circumference at breast height is 34 m (112 ft)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adansonia trees produce faint growth rings, probably annually, but they are not reliable for aging specimens, because they are difficult to count and may fade away as the wood ages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Radiocarbon dating has provided data on a few individuals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A specimen of A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 digitata known as Grootboom was dated and found to be at least 1275 years old, making it one of the oldest known angiosperm trees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adapa, the first of the Mesopotamian seven sages (apkallu), was a mythical figure who unknowingly refused the gift of immortality
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The story is first attested in the Kassite period (14th century BC), in fragmentary tablets from Tell el-Amarna, and from Assur, of the late second millennium BC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mesopotamian myth tells of seven antediluvian sages, who were sent by Ea, the wise god of Eridu, to bring the arts of civilisation to humankind
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The first of these, Adapa, also known as Uan, the name given as Oannes by Berossus, introduced the practice of the correct rites of religious observance as priest of the E'Apsu temple, at Eridu
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The sages are described in Mesopotamian literature as 'pure parādu-fish, probably carp, whose bones are found associated with the earliest shrine, and still kept as a holy duty in the precincts of Near Eastern mosques and monasteries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adapa as a fisherman was iconographically portrayed as a fish-man composite

Adaptability (Latin: adaptō "fit to, adjust") is a feature of a system or of a process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This word has been put to use as a specialised term in different disciplines and in business operations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Word definitions of adaptability as a specialised term differ little from dictionary definitions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 According to Andresen and Gronau adaptability in the field of organizational management can in general be seen as an ability to change something or oneself to fit to occurring changes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In ecology, adaptability has been described as the ability to cope with unexpected disturbances in the environment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

With respect to business and manufacturing systems and processes adaptability has come to be seen increasingly as an important factor for their efficiency and economic success
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In contrast, adaptability and efficiency are held to be in opposition to each other in biological and ecological systems, requiring a trade-off, since both are important factors in the success of such systems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 To determine the adaptability of a process or a system, it should be validated concerning some criteria

In biology, adaptation has three related meanings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Firstly it is the dynamic evolutionary process that fits a population of organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thirdly, it is a phenotypic or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has been evolved by natural selection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Organisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they grow, and show adaptive plasticity as traits develop in response to the imposed conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This gives them resilience to varying environments

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thirdly, it is a phenotypic or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has been evolved by natural selection
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Organisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they grow, and show adaptive plasticity as traits develop in response to the imposed conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This gives them resilience to varying environments

In biology, adaptation has three related meanings

An (electrical) adapter or adaptor is a device that converts attributes of one electrical device or system to those of an otherwise incompatible device or system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one electrical connector to another

Addition (often signified by the plus symbol "+") is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, in the picture on the right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together, making a total of five apples
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression "3 + 2 = 5" i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, "3 add 2 is equal to 5"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical objects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Using systematic generalizations, addition can also be defined on more abstract quantities, such as integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In arithmetic, rules for addition involving fractions and negative numbers have been devised amongst others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In algebra, addition is studied more abstractly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Addition has several important properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is commutative, meaning that order does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see Summation)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting; addition of 0 does not change a number
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adaptive behavior refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term life skills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, a constant repetitive action could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of abnormality or mental dysfunction, since its assessment is relatively free from subjectivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, many behaviors considered moral can be maladaptive, such as dissent or abstinence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Maladaptive behavior may be affected by mechanisms in the brain that lead to addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Regarding addiction as a disease provides opportunities for its treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adar (Hebrew: אֲדָר‎ Adar; from Akkadian adaru) is the sixth month of the civil year and the twelfth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar, roughly corresponding to the month of March in the Gregorian calendar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a winter month of 29 days
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Month of Adar in the Holy Scriptures comprises in Esther 09, 21
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In leap years, it is preceded by a 30-day intercalary month named Adar Aleph (Hebrew: אדר א'‎, Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, also known as "Adar Rishon" (First Adar) or "Adar I") and it is then itself called Adar Bet (Hebrew: אדר ב'‎, Bet being the second letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, also known as "Adar Sheni" (Second Adar) or "Adar II")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Occasionally instead of Adar I and Adar II, "Adar" and "Ve'Adar" are used (Ve means 'and' thus: And Adar)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adar I and II occur during February–March on the Gregorian calendar
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Based on a line in the Mishnah declaring that Purim must be celebrated in Adar II in a leap year (Megillah 1:4), Adar I is considered the "extra" month
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As a result, someone born in Adar during a non leap year would celebrate his birthday in Adar II during a leap year
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, someone born during either Adar in a leap year will celebrate his birthday during Adar in a non-leap year, except that someone born on 30 Adar I will celebrate his birthday on 1 Nisan in a non-leap year because Adar in a non-leap year has only 29 days
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

During the Second Temple period, there was a Jewish custom to make a public proclamation on the first day of the lunar month Adar, reminding the people that they are to prepare their annual monetary offering to the Temple treasury, known as the half-Shekel

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown in the majority of cases
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
1 million people
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other disorders, as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within the normal-range
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

ADHD management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling, lifestyle changes, and medications
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The British guideline only recommends medications as a first-line treatment in children who have severe symptoms and for medication to be considered in those with moderate symptoms who either refuse or fail to improve with counseling, though for adults medications are a first-line treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Canadian and American guidelines recommend that medications and behavioral therapy be used together as a first-line therapy, except in preschool-aged children
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Stimulant medication therapy is not recommended as a first-line therapy in preschool-aged children in either guideline
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Treatment with stimulants is effective for up to 14 months; however, its long term effectiveness is unclear
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adolescents and adults tend to develop coping skills which make up for some or all of their impairments
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The medical literature has described symptoms similar to ADHD since the 19th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been considered controversial since the 1970s
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Topics include ADHD's causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder in children and adults, and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The condition was officially known as attention deficit disorder (ADD) from 1980 to 1987 while before this it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), also known as the white antelope and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope of the genus Addax, that lives in the Sahara desert
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was first described by Henri de Blainville in 1816
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As suggested by its alternative name, this pale antelope has long, twisted horns - typically 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 in) in females and 70 to 85 cm (28 to 33 in) in males
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Males stand from 105 to 115 cm (41 to 45 in) at the shoulder, with females at 95 to 110 cm (37 to 43 in)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The colour of the coat depends on the season - in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The addax mainly eats grasses and leaves of any available shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These animals are well-adapted to exist in their desert habitat, as they can live without water for long periods of time
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are led by the oldest female
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The addax is a critically endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, it is quite common in captivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Western Sahara
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A value chain is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The concept comes through business management and was first described by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


The concept of value chains as decision support tools, was added onto the competitive strategies paradigm developed by Porter as early as 1979
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Porter's value chains, Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Marketing and Sales, and Service are categorized as primary activities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Secondary activities include Procurement, Human Resource management, Technological Development and Infrastructure (Porter 1985, pp
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 11–15)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

According to the OECD Secretary-General (Gurría 2012) the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises (Gurría 2012)

An addendum, in general, is an addition required to be made to a document by its author subsequent to its printing or publication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It comes from the Latin verbal phrase addendum est, being the gerundive form of the verb addo, addere, addidi, additum, "to give to, add to", meaning "(that which) must be added"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addenda is from the plural form addenda sunt, "(those things) which must be added"

Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them) and intrinsically rewarding (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB, a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As described by two groups of researchers, addiction exacts an "astoundingly high financial and human toll" on individuals and society as a whole through the direct adverse effects of drugs, associated healthcare costs, long-term complications (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, lung cancer with smoking tobacco, liver cirrhosis with drinking alcohol, or meth mouth from intravenous methamphetamine), the functional consequences of altered neural plasticity in the brain, and the consequent loss of productivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include: alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, food addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 is gambling addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Epigenetics are stable heritable traits (or "phenotypes") that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Greek prefix epi- (ἐπι- "over, outside of, around") in epigenetics implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional genetic basis for inheritance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Epigenetics often refers to changes in a chromosome that affect gene activity and expression, but can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change that does not derive from a modification of the genome, such as prions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors, or be part of normal developmental program
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable, either in the progeny of cells or of organisms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These epigenetic changes may last through cell divisions for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote – continues to divide, the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, endothelium of blood vessels, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Historically, some phenomena not necessarily heritable have also been described as epigenetic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, the term epigenetic has been used to describe any modification of chromosomal regions, especially histone modifications, whether or not these changes are heritable or associated with a phenotype
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The consensus definition now requires a trait to be heritable for it to be considered epigenetic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Misuse of the scientific term by quack authors has created misinformation and controversy in the public

Addition (often signified by the plus symbol "+") is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, in the picture on the right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together, making a total of five apples
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression "3 + 2 = 5" i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, "3 add 2 is equal to 5"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical objects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Using systematic generalizations, addition can also be defined on more abstract quantities, such as integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In arithmetic, rules for addition involving fractions and negative numbers have been devised amongst others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In algebra, addition is studied more abstractly
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Addition has several important properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is commutative, meaning that order does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see Summation)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting; addition of 0 does not change a number
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day

The Order of Australia is an order of chivalry established on 14 February 1975 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, to recognise Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Before the establishment of the order, Australian citizens received British honours
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Queen of Australia is Sovereign Head of the Order, while the Governor-General is Principal Companion/Dame/Knight (as relevant at the time) and Chancellor of the Order
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Governor-General's Official Secretary is Secretary of the Order

An idiot, dolt, dullard or (archaically) mome is a person perceived to be lacking intelligence, or someone who acts in a self-defeating or significantly counterproductive way
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Along with the similar terms moron, imbecile, and cretin, the word archaically referred to the intellectually disabled, but have all since gained specialized meanings in modern times
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An idiot is said to be idiotic, and to suffer from idiocy

James Thurston Nabors (born June 12, 1930) is a retired American actor, singer, and comedian
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Born and raised in Sylacauga, Alabama, Nabors moved to southern California because of his asthma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While working at a Santa Monica nightclub, The Horn, he was discovered by Andy Griffith and later joined The Andy Griffith Show, playing Gomer Pyle
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Nabors, Betty Lynn Elinor Donahue, and Ron Howard are the last surviving regular cast members from that series
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The character proved popular, and Nabors was given his own spin-off show, Gomer Pyle, U

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Though known for his portrayal of Gomer Pyle, Nabors became a popular guest on variety shows in the 1960s and 1970s (including two specials of his own in 1969 and 1974), which showcased his rich baritone voice, and sometimes his higher-pitched voice
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He subsequently recorded numerous albums and singles, most of them containing romantic ballads
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Nabors is also known for singing "Back Home Again in Indiana", prior to the start of the Indianapolis 500, held annually over the Memorial Day Weekend
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Save for occasional absences due to health or other conflicts, Nabors sang the unofficial Indiana anthem almost every year from 1972 until his final time in 2014

Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them) and intrinsically rewarding (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB, a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As described by two groups of researchers, addiction exacts an "astoundingly high financial and human toll" on individuals and society as a whole through the direct adverse effects of drugs, associated healthcare costs, long-term complications (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, lung cancer with smoking tobacco, liver cirrhosis with drinking alcohol, or meth mouth from intravenous methamphetamine), the functional consequences of altered neural plasticity in the brain, and the consequent loss of productivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include: alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, food addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 is gambling addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal

Adelaide ( AD-ə-layd) is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-most populous city of Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In June 2016, Adelaide had an estimated resident population of 1,326,354
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 South Australia, with a total of 1
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
7 million inhabitants, has the most centralised population of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of its people living in greater Adelaide, while the other population centres in the state are relatively small
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges which surround the city
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adelaide stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 94 to 104 km (58 to 65 mi) from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Named in honour of Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for a freely-settled British province in Australia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the River Torrens, in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Light's design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Early Adelaide was shaped by prosperity and wealth—until the Second World War, it was Australia's third-largest city and one of the few Australian cities to not have convict history
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been noted for early examples of religious freedom, a commitment to political progressivism and civil liberties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It has been known as the "City of Churches" since the mid-19th century
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The demonym "Adelaidean" is used in reference to the city and its residents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevard of North Terrace, King William Street and in various districts of the metropolitan area
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Today, Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It ranks highly in terms of liveability, being listed in the Top 10 of The Economist Intelligence Unit's World's Most Liveable Cities index in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was also ranked the most liveable city in Australia by the Property Council of Australia in 2011, 2012 and 2013
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adelges is a genus of insects which feed on conifers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Excepting galls formed by the spruce gall midge, galls are caused by aphid-like insects of the family Phylloxeridae (Adelgidae) commonly known as the spruce gall adelgids
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have complex life cycles, some species feeding exclusively on spruce, others feeding on spruce and an alternate conifer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, galls characteristic of each species are formed only on spruce
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Six generations are usually needed to complete the 2-year cycle, and in the case of species having an alternate host, winged adults about 2 mm long are formed only in the generations that move from one host to the other
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The spruce gall adelgid (Adelges lariciatus Patch) occurs in alternate years on spruce and larch from Alberta to the Maritimes and in adjacent parts of the United States
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The pale spruce gall adelgid (Adelges strobilobius Kaltenbach) has a similar range but prefers black spruce or red spruce to white spruce
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Species include:
Adelges abietis (Pineapple gall adelgid)
Adelges cooleyi (Gall adelgid)
Adelges piceae (Balsam woolly adelgid)
Adelges tsugae (Hemlock woolly adelgid)

The Adelgidae is a small family of the Hemiptera closely related to the aphids, and often traditionally included in the Aphidoidea with the Phylloxeridae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adelgids are often known as "woolly conifer aphids"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family is composed of species associated with pine, spruce, or other conifers, known respectively as "pine aphids" or "spruce aphids"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This family includes the former family Chermesidae, or "Chermidae", the name of which was declared invalid by the ICZN in 1955
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There is still considerable debate as to the number of genera within the family, and the classification is still unstable and inconsistent among competing authors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

There are about fifty species of adelgids known
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 All of them are native to the northern hemisphere, although some have been introduced to the southern hemisphere as invasive species
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Unlike aphids, the adelgids have no tail-like cauda and no cornicles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adelgids only lay eggs, and never give birth to live nymphs as aphids do
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adelgids are covered with dense woolly wax
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A complete adelgid life cycle lasts two years
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adelgid nymphs are known as sistentes, and the overwintering sistentes are called neosistens
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Rain can kill adelgids by dislodging eggs and sistentes from trees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Ademption, or ademption by extinction, is a common law doctrine used in the law of wills to determine what happens when property bequeathed under a will is no longer in the testator's estate at the time of the testator's death
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a specific gift), such property is considered adeemed, and the gift fails
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would be adeemed and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

General bequests or general gifts - gifts of cash amounts - are never adeemed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If the cash in the testator's estate is not sufficient to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the residuary estate will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some property lies in a "gray" area, in which the testator's specific intent must be determined
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, where the testator bequeathes "500 shares of stock" in a company, this may be read as a general bequest (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a specific bequest, particularly if the testator used a possessive ("my 500 shares")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such a gift is deemed to be a demonstrative gift
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 If one were to bequeath "500 shares of stock," most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The resultant gift to the heir receiving "500 shares," would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Ademption may be waived if the property leaves the estate after the testator has been declared incompetent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Furthermore, in some cases the beneficiary will be entitled to the proceeds from the sale of property, or to the insurance payout for property that is lost or destroyed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To avoid confusion as to what may or may not be adeemed, sometimes the phrase "if owned by me at my death" is placed into the articles of a will in which property is being bequeathed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As for the sale of land under an executory contract, traditional case law agrees that ademption occurs upon the death of the testator and that the proceeds of sale, when the closing occurs, should not pass to the specific devisee of the property
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, the more modern view and the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by some states, disagrees
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These jurisdictions find that when property subject to specific devise is placed under contract of sale before the decedent's death, the proceeds of the sale will pass to the specific devisee
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aden (UK:  AY-duhn, US:  AH-den; Arabic: عدن‎‎ ʻAdin/ʻAdan  Yemeni pronunciation: [ˈʕæden, ˈʕædæn]) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some 170 km (110 mi) east of Bab-el-Mandeb
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its population is approximately 800,000 people
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aden consists of a number of distinct sub-centres: Crater, the original port city; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, known as "Steamer Point" in the colonial period; and the resorts of Gold Mohur
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Khormaksar, located on the isthmus that connects Aden proper with the mainland, includes the city's diplomatic missions, the main offices of Aden University, and Aden International Airport (the former British Royal Air Force station RAF Khormaksar), Yemen's second biggest airport
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 On the mainland are the sub-centres of Sheikh Othman, a former oasis area; Al-Mansura, a town planned by the British; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Itihad), the site designated as the capital of the South Arabian Federation and now home to a large power/desalinization facility and additional faculties of Aden University
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that comprises the modern port
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The volcanic peninsula of Little Aden forms a near-mirror image, enclosing the harbour and port on the western side
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Little Aden became the site of the oil refinery and tanker port
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Aden was the capital of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen until that country's unification with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1990, and again briefly served as Yemen's temporary capital during the aftermath of the 2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état, as declared by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi after he fled the Houthi occupation of Sana'a
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 From March to July 2015, the Battle of Aden raged between Houthis and loyalists to President Hadi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Water, food, and medical supplies ran short in the city
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 On 14 July, the Saudi Army launched an offensive to retake Aden for Hadi's government
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adenanthera is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It contains the following species:
Adenanthera bicolor Merr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (Sri Lanka)
Adenanthera intermedia Merr
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (Philippines)
Adenanthera pavonina L
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adenine  (A, Ade) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its derivatives have a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It also has functions in protein synthesis and as a chemical component of DNA and RNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The image on the right shows pure adenine, as an independent molecule
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 When connected into DNA, a covalent bond is formed between deoxyribose sugar and the bottom left nitrogen, so removing the hydrogen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The remaining structure is called an adenine residue, as part of a larger molecule
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenosine is adenine reacted with ribose as used in RNA and ATP; deoxyadenosine, adenine attached to deoxyribose, as is used to form DNA
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adenitis is a general term for an inflammation of a gland
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Often it is used to refer to lymphadenitis which is the inflammation of a lymph node
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenium is a genus of flowering plants in the Apocynum family, Apocynaceae, first described as a genus in 1819
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenocarcinoma (; plural adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinomata ) is a type of cancerous tumor that can occur in several parts of the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thus invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer, is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name—however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the most specific usage (narrowest sense), the glandular origin or traits are exocrine; endocrine gland tumors, such as a VIPoma, an insulinoma, or a pheochromocytoma, are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called neuroendocrine tumors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a gland, as long as they have secretory properties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenocarcinoma is the malignant counterpart to adenoma, which is the benign form of such tumors
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sometimes adenomas transform into adenocarcinomas, but most do not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Well differentiated adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 By staining the cells from a biopsy, a pathologist can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the potency of epithelial cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While each gland may not be secreting the same substance, as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell, it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The adenoid, also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil, is the superior-most of the tonsils
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a mass of lymphatic tissue situated posterior to the nasal cavity, in the roof of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the throat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Normally, in children, it forms a soft mound in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx, just above and behind the uvula
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoids for reasons which include impaired breathing through the nose, chronic infections, or recurrent earaches
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The surgery is less commonly performed in adults in whom adenoids are considered vestigial and purposeless
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Post-operative pain is generally minimal and reduced by icy or cold foods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The procedure can be combined with tonsillectomy if indicated and recovery time can range from several hours to two or three days (though as age increases so does recovery time)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adenoidectomy is not often performed under one year of age as adenoid function is part of the body's immune system but its contribution to this decreases progressively beyond this age
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An adenoma (from Greek αδένας, adeno-, "gland" + -ώμα, -oma, "tumor") (; plural adenomas or adenomata ) is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Although adenomas are benign, over time they may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most adenomas do not transform
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 But even while benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some adenomas are too small to be seen macroscopically but can still cause clinical symptoms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Lymphadenopathy or adenopathy is disease of the lymph nodes, in which they are abnormal in size, number, or consistency
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lymphadenopathy of an inflammatory type (the most common type) is lymphadenitis, producing swollen or enlarged lymph nodes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In clinical practice, the distinction between lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis is rarely made and the words are usually treated as synonymous
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Inflammation of the lymphatic vessels is known as lymphangitis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Infectious lymphadenitides affecting lymph nodes in the neck are often called scrofula
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The term comes from the word lymph and a combination of the Greek words αδένας, adenas ("gland") and παθεία, patheia ("act of suffering" or "disease")
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Lymphadenopathy is a common and nonspecific sign
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common causes include infections (from minor ones such as the common cold to dangerous ones such as HIV/AIDS), autoimmune diseases, and cancers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Lymphadenopathy is also frequently idiopathic and self-limiting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenosine is a purine nucleoside composed of a molecule of adenine attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a β-N9-glycosidic bond
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenosine is widely found in nature and plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer—as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)—as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is also a neuromodulator, believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In addition to adenosine's endogenous forms, it is also used as a medication, specifically, as an antiarrhythmic agent, to treat a number of forms of supraventricular tachycardia that do not improve with vagal maneuvers
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Common side effects include chest pain, feeling faint, shortness of breath along with tingling of the senses 
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It appears to be safe in pregnancy
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenota is an alternative genus or sub-genus within the Reduncinae sub-family of family Bovidae, composed of the species Kobus kob (Kob) and Kobus vardonii (Puku)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was described by Nowak in 1991
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90–100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double stranded DNA genome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (known as the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system

In his seminal work Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Noam Chomsky introduces a hierarchy of Levels of Adequacy for evaluating grammars (theories of specific languages) and metagrammars (theories of grammars)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

These levels constitute a taxonomy of theories (a grammar of a natural language being an example of such a theory) according to potency
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This taxonomy might be extended to scientific theories in general, and from there even stretched into the realm of the aesthetics of art
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This present article's use of the phrase as a terminus technicus should not be confused with its everyday language uses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In mathematics, an adherent point (also closure point or point of closure or contact point) of a subset A of a topological space X, is a point x in X such that every open set containing x contains at least one point of A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A point x is an adherent point for A if and only if x is in the closure of A
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This definition differs from that of a limit point, in that for a limit point it is required that every open set containing 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains at least one point of A different from x
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thus every limit point is an adherent point, but the converse is not true
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An adherent point of A is either a limit point of A or an element of A (or both)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An adherent point which is not a limit point is an isolated point
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Intuitively, having an open set A defined as the area within (but not including) some boundary, the adherent points of A are those of A including the boundary
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
A self-adhering bandage or cohesive bandage is a type of bandage or wrap that coheres to itself, but does not adhere well to other surfaces
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Because of this, it is commonly used as a wrap on limbs, since it will stick to itself and not loosen
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is used on humans, but also commonly used as a wrap on the legs of livestock because it will not stick to hair, so it is easily removed
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adhesion is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another (cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles/surfaces to cling to one another)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to the cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are certain emergent mechanical effects
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adhesive may be used interchangeably with glue, cement, mucilage, or paste, and is any substance applied to one surface, or both surfaces, of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adjectives may be used in conjunction with the word "adhesive" to describe properties based on the substance's physical or chemical form, the type of materials joined, or conditions under which it is applied
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The use of adhesives offers many advantages over binding techniques such as sewing, mechanical fastening, thermal bonding, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The earliest human use of adhesive-like substances was approximately 200,000 years ago, when Neanderthals produced tar from the dry distillation of birch bark for use in binding stone tools to wooden handles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
The first references to adhesives in literature first appeared in approximately 2000 BCE
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In Europe, glue was not widely used until the period 1500–1700 CE
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 From then until the 1900s increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly, and innovation in the field continues to the present

Agostino Valier (7 April 1531 – 24 May 1606), also Augustinus Valerius or Valerio, was an Italian cardinal and bishop of Verona
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was a reforming bishop, putting into effect the decisions of the Council of Trent by means of administrative and disciplinary measures
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was one of the Christian humanist followers of Filippo Neri
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
John William Money (8 July 1921 – 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of "gender" affect an individual
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His work has been both celebrated for its innovation and criticized, particularly in regard to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Money published around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 His writing has been translated into many languages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Money has received around 65 world-wide honors, awards, and degrees, but has been discredited by, most notably, David Reimer, prior to his suicide

Adoration (Latin) is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term comes from the Latin adōrātiō, meaning "to give homage or worship to someone or something"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to its surroundings only as work
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term "adiabatic approximation", meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

By way of example, the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adiantaceae (as construed here, sensu strictu, not a synonym of Pteridaceae) is a family of ferns in the order Pteridales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This includes the family formerly known as the "Vittariaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
" Recent genetic analyses based on chloroplast genes demonstrate that the vittarioid ferns cladistically nest within the genus Adiantum, making that genus paraphyletic
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------


The vittarioid ferns are primarily epiphytic in tropical regions and all have simple leaves with sori that follow the veins and lack true indusia; the sori are most often marginal with a false indusium formed from the reflexed leaf margin
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The family also includes a species, Vittaria appalachiana, that is highly unusual in that the sporophyte stage of the life cycle is absent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This species consists solely of photosynthetic gametophytes that reproduce asexually
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The ferns historically considered as Adiantum include both petrophilic and terrestrial plants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most of the species in this genus do compose a clade within the family, but apparently Adiantum raddianum and possibly some related species constitute a clade that is sister to the vittarioids combined with the rest of the genus Adiantum
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

This family is most closely allied with the Pellaeaceae within the Pteridales
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Based on phylogenetic research, Smith et al
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (2006) included Adiantaceae as part of the family Pteridaceae and Christenhusz et al
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (2011) listed its genera in Vittarioideae (C
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Presl) Crabbe, Jermy & Mickel 1975, one of five subfamilies of Pteridaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adiantum , the walking fern or maidenhair fern, is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the Vittarioideae subfamily of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The genus name comes from Greek, meaning "not wetting", referring to the fronds' ability to shed water without becoming wet
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Adige (Italian pronunciation: [ˈaːdidʒe]; German: Etsch [ɛtʃ]; Venetian: Àdexe; Romansh:  Adisch ; Ladin: Adesc; Latin: Athesis; Ancient Greek: Ἄθεσις) is the second longest river in Italy after the Po, rising in the Alps in the province of South Tyrol near the Italian border with Austria and Switzerland, flowing 410 kilometres (250 mi) through most of North-East Italy to the Adriatic Sea
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adipocere (), also known as corpse, grave or mortuary wax, is a wax-like organic substance formed by the anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of fat in tissue, such as body fat in corpses
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In its formation, putrefaction is replaced by a permanent firm cast of fatty tissues, internal organs, and the face
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In biology, adipose tissue , body fat, or simply fat is a loose connective tissue composed mostly of adipocytes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and a variety of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Far from being hormonally inert, adipose tissue has, in recent years, been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which generates body heat
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adipose tissue – more specifically brown adipose tissue – was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551

An adit (from Latin aditus, entrance) is an entrance to an underground mine which is horizontal or nearly horizontal, by which the mine can be entered, drained of water, ventilated, and minerals extracted at the lowest convenient level
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adits are also used to explore for mineral veins
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In the Vedas, Aditi (Sanskrit: अदिति "limitless") is mother of the gods (devamata) and all twelve zodiacal spirits from whose cosmic matrix, the heavenly bodies were born
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space (akasa) and with mystic speech (Vāc)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 She may be seen as a feminized form of Brahma and associated with the primal substance (mulaprakriti) in Vedanta
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 She is mentioned nearly 80 times in the Rigveda: the verse "Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha" is seen by Theosophists as a reference to "the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence" and divine wisdom
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In contrast, the Puranas, such as the Shiva Purana and the Bhagavata Purana, suggest that Aditi is wife of sage Kashyap and gave birth to the Adityas such as Indra, Surya, and also Vamana
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In Hinduism, Ādityas (Sanskrit: आदित्य, pronounced [ɑːd̪it̪jɐ]), meaning "of Aditi", refers to the offspring of Aditi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name, Aditya, is used in the singular to mean the Sun God, Surya
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The Bhagavata Purana lists a total of twelve Adityas as Sun-gods
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In each month of the year a different Aditya is said to shine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each of these Adityas is a different expression of Lord Vishnu in the form of the Sun-God

 Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them) and intrinsically rewarding (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB, a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 ΔFosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

As described by two groups of researchers, addiction exacts an "astoundingly high financial and human toll" on individuals and society as a whole through the direct adverse effects of drugs, associated healthcare costs, long-term complications (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, lung cancer with smoking tobacco, liver cirrhosis with drinking alcohol, or meth mouth from intravenous methamphetamine), the functional consequences of altered neural plasticity in the brain, and the consequent loss of productivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include: alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, food addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 is gambling addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adventitious has various meanings in various disciplines and in general usage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adventitious is from the Latin root advenire, meaning "to come to" and in English the meanings tend to have connections to "accidental/ casual occurrence", "arising from without; supervenient, accidental, casual"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

People sometimes speak of an event or occurrence as being "random", when the word "adventitious", or perhaps "accidental", might be more strictly correct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated adj) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adjectives are one of the English parts of speech, although historically they were classed together with the nouns
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives, including the, this, my, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, are today usually classed separately, as determiners

Tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) is a grammar formalism defined by Aravind Joshi
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Tree-adjoining grammars are somewhat similar to context-free grammars, but the elementary unit of rewriting is the tree rather than the symbol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Whereas context-free grammars have rules for rewriting symbols as strings of other symbols, tree-adjoining grammars have rules for rewriting the nodes of trees as other trees (see tree (graph theory) and tree (data structure))

In parliamentary procedure, an adjournment ends a meeting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It could be done using a motion to adjourn
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A time for another meeting could be set using the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This motion establishes an adjourned meeting
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

To adjourn to another time or place means to suspend proceedings until a later stated time or place

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
An adjudicator is someone who presides, judges, and arbitrates during a formal dispute or competition
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They have numerous purposes, including preliminary legal judgments, to determine applicant eligibility, or to assess contenders' performance in competitions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
In linguistics, an adjunct is an optional, or structurally dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, if removed or discarded, will not otherwise affect the remainder of the sentence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Example: In the sentence John helped Bill in Central Park, the phrase in Central Park is an adjunct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with adverbial function
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 An adjunct is not an argument (nor is it a predicative expression), and an argument is not an adjunct
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The argument–adjunct distinction is central in most theories of syntax and semantics
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The terminology used to denote arguments and adjuncts can vary depending on the theory at hand
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some dependency grammars, for instance, employ the term circonstant (instead of adjunct), following Tesnière (1959)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The area of grammar that explores the nature of predicates, their arguments, and adjuncts is called valency theory
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Predicates have valency; they determine the number and type of arguments that can or must appear in their environment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The valency of predicates is also investigated in terms of subcategorization
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------



 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adoration (Latin) is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The term comes from the Latin adōrātiō, meaning "to give homage or worship to someone or something"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adjara (Georgian: აჭარა [at͡ʃʼara]), officially known as the Autonomous Republic of Adjara (Georgian: აჭარის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა [at͡ʃʼaris avtʼɔnɔmiuri rɛspʼublikʼa]), is a historical, geographic and political-administrative region of Georgia
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Located in the country's southwestern corner, Adjara lies on the coast of the Black Sea near the foot of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, north of Turkey
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is an important tourism destination and includes Georgia's second-largest city of Batumi as its capital
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 About 350,000 people live on its 2,880 km2
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adjara is home to the Adjarians, a regional subgroup of Georgians
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adjara's name can be spelled in a number of ways, including Ajara, Ajaria, Adjaria, Adzharia, and Achara, among others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Under the Soviet Union, Adjara was part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as the Adjarian ASSR

An adjustable spanner (UK, and most other English-speaking countries) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada) is an open-end wrench with a movable jaw, allowing it to be used with different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Several other names are in use, including the US trademark crescent wrench
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Claims adjuster (claim adjuster), or claims handler (claim handler), investigates insurance claims by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean and New Zealand the term loss adjuster is used
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In the United States, a claims adjuster's duties typically extend to include the following elements:
Verify an insurance policy exists for the insured person and/or property
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In general, these are written by the policy-holding insurance company
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Risk(s) of loss(es), or damages to property, culminating in the loss of property and or bodily injury
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

After completing the above investigations, evaluate the covered injuries and/or damages that have been determined according to the coverage grants
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Negotiate a settlement according to the applicable law(s), and identify coverages for which the insured is covered, following best insurance practices
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A Claims adjuster or Public Adjuster does not, and should not, engage in the practice of law
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 While adjusting the claim does mean applying the loss circumstances to the insured's policy, it does not account for if and when there becomes an issue of coverage, which is a matter and practice of Law, and should only be engaged by a properly licensed attorney
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In casualty insurance the main type of coverages include but may not be limited to the followings:
First party auto and other than auto coverages (sometimes referred to collision and comprehensive coverages) there are numerous types of first party insurance coverages for any kind of risk of loss or damages
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Third party liability for property damage of others property and bodily injury
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 (in law terms these are "tort" claims)

An adjuvant is a pharmacological or immunological agent that modifies the effect of other agents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adjuvants may be added to a vaccine to modify the immune response by boosting it such as to give a higher amount of antibodies and a longer-lasting protection, thus minimizing the amount of injected foreign material
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adjuvants may also be used to enhance the efficacy of a vaccine by helping to modify the immune response to particular types of immune system cells: for example, by activating T cells instead of antibody-secreting B cells depending on the purpose of the vaccine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adjuvants are also used in the production of antibodies from immunized animals
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There are different classes of adjuvants that can push immune response in different directions, but the most commonly used adjuvants include aluminum hydroxide and paraffin oil

Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) is a set of five ISO norms which has been developed in response to a world-wide demand for internationally harmonized specifications for medicinal products
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 IDMP provides the basis for the unique identification of medicinal products, it facilitates the activities of medicines regulatory agencies world-wide by jurisdiction for a variety of regulatory activities (development, registration and life cycle management of medicinal products; pharmacovigilance and risk management)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 IDMP is the base for the Marketing authorization of medicinal products in Europe
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It requires the five ISO Norms being implemented in the Marketing Authorization Application process
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Messaging specifications are included as an integral part of the IDMP standards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They describe and protect the integrity of the interactions for the submission of regulated medicinal product information in the context of the unique product identification; they include acknowledgement of receipt including the validation of transmitted information
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Health level Seven (HL7) Message Exchange are normative within the IDMP Standards
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

IDMP Standards are designed to allow unambiguous identification of products across regions to improve the robustness of pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 they can also be applied to Investigational Medicinal Products
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

IDMP Standards are completed with Implementation Guides which are currently in development (2017)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The standards can be found from ISO TC 215´s deliveries

Admiral is one of the highest naval ranks in some navies, and in many navies is the highest rank
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is usually abbreviated to "Adm" or "ADM"

The Admiralty formerly known as the Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs, was the government department responsible for the command of the Royal Navy first in the Kingdom of England, second in the Kingdom of Great Britain, and from 1801-1964, the United Kingdom and former British Empire
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Originally exercised by a single person, the Lord High Admiral, the Admiralty was, from the early 18th century onwards, almost invariably put "in commission" and exercised by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who sat on the Board of Admiralty
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new Admiralty Board, which is a committee of the tri-service Defence Council of the United Kingdom and part of the Navy Department  of the Ministry of Defence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a Navy Board (not to be confused with the historic Navy Board described later in this article)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is common for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to as simply The Admiralty
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the monarch from 1964 to 2011
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The title was awarded to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh by Queen Elizabeth II on his 90th birthday
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 There also continues to be a Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom and a Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, both of which are honorary offices

Admiral is one of the highest naval ranks in some navies, and in many navies is the highest rank
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is usually abbreviated to "Adm" or "ADM"
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The rank is generally thought to have originated in Sicily from a conflation of Arabic: أمير البحر‎‎, amīr al-baḥr, "commander of the sea", with Latin admirabilis ("admirable") or admiratus ("admired"), the first was admiral Lumu Farouk, although alternative etymologies derive the word directly from Latin, or from the Turkish military and naval rank miralay

Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll is an annual poll that Gallup has conducted at the end of most years since 1948
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Americans are asked, without prompting, to say what man and woman "living today in any part of the world, do [they] admire most?" The result is published as a top ten list
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Most years the most admired man is the sitting President of the United States and the most admired woman is or has been the First Lady of the United States

In electrical engineering, admittance is a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow a current to flow
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is defined as the reciprocal of impedance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The SI unit of admittance is the siemens (symbol S); the older, synonymous unit is mho, and its symbol is ℧ (an upside-down uppercase omega Ω)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Oliver Heaviside coined the term admittance in December 1887
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Admittance is defined as

  
    
      
        Y
        ≡

    {\displaystyle Y\equiv {\frac {1}{Z}}\,}
  
where
Y is the admittance, measured in siemens
Z is the impedance, measured in ohms
Resistance is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as reactance)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow, but also the dynamic effects of the material's susceptance to polarization:

The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a film's suitability for certain audiences based on its content
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The MPAA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; films can be exhibited without a rating, although many theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Non-members of MPAA may also submit films for rating
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Other media, such as television programs and video games, is rated by other entities such as the ESRB and the TV Parental Guidelines

Admonition (or "being admonished") is a punishment under Scots law when an offender has been found guilty but is neither imprisoned nor fined but receives verbal discipline and is afterwards set free; the conviction is still recorded
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This disposition is comparable to an absolute discharge in jurisdictions where an absolute discharge involves the recording of a conviction (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, where the "discharge" is from punishment only) but stands in contrast to an absolute discharge in jurisdictions in which an absolute discharge does not involve the recording of a conviction (i
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, where the "discharge" is from conviction as well)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

It is usually the result of either the strict application of law where no real wrong has been caused or where other circumstances (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 time already spent in custody or attending court) make further punishment unjust in the circumstances specific to the case involved
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Currently, admonition holds a 5 year disclosure period due to absence of mention in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and thus being classified as an "other" offence

The index finger (also referred to as forefinger, first finger, pointer finger, trigger finger, digitus secundus, digitus II, and many other terms), is the first finger and the second digit of a human hand
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is located between the first and third digits, between the thumb and the middle finger
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is usually the most dextrous and sensitive finger of the hand, though not the longest – it is shorter than the middle finger, and may be shorter or longer than the ring finger – see digit ratio
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

"Index finger" literally means "pointing finger", from the same Latin source as indicate; its anatomical names are "index finger" and "second digit"

The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 They are found above the kidneys
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production is associated with Addison's disease
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases

Adobe (US: , UK: ; Spanish: [aˈðoβe]) is a building material made from earth and often organic material
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adobe means mudbrick in Spanish, but in some English speaking regions of Spanish heritage it refers to any kind of earth construction, as most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world

Adobo or Adobar (Spanish: marinade, sauce, or seasoning) is the immersion of raw food in a stock (or sauce) composed variously of paprika, oregano, salt, garlic, and vinegar to preserve and enhance its flavor
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The Portuguese variant is known as Carne de vinha d'alhos
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The practice is native to Iberia, namely Spanish cuisine and Portuguese cuisine
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It was widely adopted in Latin America and other Spanish and Portuguese colonies, including the Azores and Madeira
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In the Philippines, the name adobo was given by the Spanish colonists to an indigenous cooking method that also uses vinegar, which, although superficially similar, had developed independently of Spanish influence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adolescence (from Latin adolescere, meaning 'to grow up') is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority)
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Physical growth (particularly in males), and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Thus age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered (chronologically and legally) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In studying adolescent development, adolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
g
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
, worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, and argue that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not inherent

Adolf, also spelled Adolph and sometimes Latinised to Adolphus, is a given name used in German-speaking countries, in Scandinavia, in the Netherlands and Flanders and to a lesser extent in various Central European countries
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adolphus can also appear as a surname, as in John Adolphus, the English historian
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

The name is a compound derived from the Old High German Athalwolf, a composition of athal, or adal, meaning noble, and wolf; compare Rudolf
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 The name is cognate to the Anglo-Saxon name Æthelwulf

The Adopted (original title: Les Adoptés) is a 2011 French drama film directed and co-written by Mélanie Laurent
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It stars Marie Denarnaud, Denis Ménochet, Laurent and Clémentine Célarié
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Denis Ménochet won a Lumières Award for Most Promising Actor for his performance in the film
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations

Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents

Adaptive behavior refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term life skills
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, a constant repetitive action could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of abnormality or mental dysfunction, since its assessment is relatively free from subjectivity
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 However, many behaviors considered moral can be maladaptive, such as dissent or abstinence
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Maladaptive behavior may be affected by mechanisms in the brain that lead to addiction
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Regarding addiction as a disease provides opportunities for its treatment
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------

Adaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others
 -----------------------------END---------------------------------
 It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally
